# Hologram

Our reality here on earth is a hologram, a matrix, a simulation, a simulacrum. It's a bit pithy, and it fits in quite well with the technology-driven cognitive dystopia we can call the global narrative -- the non-stop, cradle to grave, thought-womb propaganda, digital, analog, and paper -- we are immersed in daily. It's in our literature, our music, our movies, our science. It's all fake, don't you know? Elon Musk says he's almost certain we live in a computer simulation. If you watch a lot of science fiction, you may have noticed it's all artificial light or darkness, very few sunny days. Why don't they ever explain what happens to consciousness in space? How does gravity affect our thoughts? If twenty-one grams leaves the body upon death, what does a weightless environment do for that other part? It's not that they don't know. They do. The disparity between what they know and what they encourage us to believe is so great now we may as well be separate species, literally separate species.

That would explain the contempt, the indifference, the empathy dislocation. Psychopathy is an evolution in their minds. How could they empathize with us? We're not them. They're like a separate species. No religion or knowledge school has served humanity in a long time. We were in a lockdown long before the virus. The growth of consciousness has been greatly discouraged here. Those were the rules of the hologram.

Here's the skinny on all this being a simulation -- yes and no. If we wanted to be obtuse, we could probably make the case it's some kind of hologram, but that begs the question -- what's projecting it? Space-time is an infinite set of coordinates atop existence. Existence itself goes beyond time. Time is a temporary condition, which is why we have irony. Nothing in time can escape it because it's built right into the time. Time is the measurement of things that come and go in the hologram of the earth. Every cell has a clock in it, a best before date, an expiry. We're born to die.

A hologram as defined here is a three-dimensional sound and light projection. Everything around us is part of the hologram -- the street on which we live, our mother and father, our pets, everything. If this is a hologram then what's real? The answer is a paradox.

Our reality is simultaneously real and unreal. It depends on us. The idea that our earthbound reality is a matrix has been around for millennia. A synonym is Maya from the Buddhist and Hindu teachings. When the Buddhists and the Hindus use the word Maya they mean illusion. The world we perceive through our senses is a complete and total illusion. It doesn't make sense, though, does it? We eat and the food is real, tangible, tactile, and flavored. We don't drive an imaginary car to the hardware store. Try telling your creditors you've deemed your mortgage payments an illusion. See how long you retain your home. We are confronted with the real and the unreal at the same time. It's a paradox, which is something that is both real and unreal at the same time, a cohesive contradiction, like time being temporary.

It's important then that we be clear in our text what is meant by hologram. Reality is a projection from another dimension or dimensions. The projection from the other dimensions produces the relatively consistent ruleset which provides the appearance of reality, but it's paper-thin. The ruleset is broken all the time, but nobody is broadcasting it, so we don't hear about it. The ruleset is broken in scientific communities, mystical communities, magical communities, native communities, and many more. What happens when we break the ruleset? Like the ring keeper in Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_, we keep it secret, we keep it safe. Those we tell are spoken to in whisper, as if evidence of our uncertainty, a footnote to our grappling with the paradox.

Most mystery schools, secret societies, brotherhoods, magical and ritual communities exist in some version of this secret. Why? Do they not want to let the world know? It's a combination of factors, but, chief among them, is the understanding that without the ability to take the person you're telling the secret to out of the ruleset as well, they're not going to believe it. This is the hologram we live within, a breakable ruleset enforced as absolute by those who have not broken the ruleset, God's bell curve, if you will.

The hologram is symbiotic with our consciousness. We can speak into and affect the hologram, which we then experience as our effect. Yeah, it's that simple. This is the deep part of us that is the same as what made the hologram, and we, therefore, are co-creators with the prime creator. Yes, it's a hologram, but it's a hologram projected by a creator. That makes it a divine hologram.

The deliberate attempt to desecrate the symbiotic space of spirit and matter humans exist within has been the foundation of our enslavement. Humans believe anything. You could almost look upon it as a belief engine. We've lived within them since the beginning of time. Our mythologies were real because we believed them. We believed our mythologies because they were real. The gods spoke to people in the past. Some contemporary thinkers suggest scriptures and mythologies were maps of consciousness, precursors to the unconscious opened up by psychology. Yeah, they're maps. The map of consciousness is the map of reality, physical reality, psychic reality, and spiritual reality.

We live in a divine hologram that allows us to co-create alongside what created us, but that possibility, that necessity, that heritage has been kept from us, purposely determined for us, and we were commodified. The world we live in now, ugly as it might be at times, is as close to the manifest truth as it's always been. You can see the Pharaohs, the titled class, the slaves, and the utterly commodified, the bought and sold human beings of the blackest market ever created.

# Sound and Light

The chief characteristic of our hologram is sound and light. Light is a boundary for the time in our world. When we look up at the stars we see the past in the present. The image of the star is dated by the time it took for the light to reach our eyes. Some stars we see in their distant past, but, for us, it's the present. We look up and there it is. Never once do we consider we are seeing the past, but we are.

It's important to understand the lesson of the visiting starlight. It's important because it breaks the ruleset. The ruleset says that only the present moment is real. The past is memory and the future is speculation, both of which take place in our thoughts, in our heads, ergo, not a part of the objective reality. The starlight we see in the present is from the past.

The physical light we see, both from the stars and our sun, follows the ruleset of this three-dimensional reality. It cannot exceed the allotted speed of light, which is 299,792 kilometers per second, or, 186,282 miles per second. It's pretty fast. At that speed, we could circumscribe the earth seven and a half times in one second.

There are so many creation stories -- The Garden of Eden and the rather horrid unfolding of Genesis, the incredible tales of the turtle universe from the Iroquois Confederacy in Canada, or the novel, post-modern schoolroom of soul narrative the new age favors. They're all versions of the same story.

What we have lost in our understanding of those stories is their original context. Context cannot be overstated. Absent context -- space-time is an infinite set of coordinates atop existence -- we don't know where we are in existence. A body is a base instrument, a DNA skinsuit, by which to experience reality, in this case, our reality, which is called earth in the early twenty-first century, or so we've been told. How the hell would we know the difference? Flat earth has been resurrected. Humans will believe anything.

To understand this divine hologram, we have to understand sound and light. Without it, nothing exists. It is the essence of the prime creator, the building blocks of all things. There are many kinds of light. There are many kinds of sound. Every thought you have ever had, every feeling you've ever had, are all just expressions of this sound and light. Thunder and lightning. Raw energy. Every picture in your head is illuminated. Where does the light come from? How do you see pictures in your head without light? Light is the foundation of all contrast. The contrast gives form. Forms give context. Context is purpose. After the context come the details.

What has evolved in popular culture is an impotent hologram, a matrix created by a diabolical force, a mechanistic force. This is the Free Masonic version of the absent god, the universe run by automation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Everything in existence is touched by the prime creator. It's here we flip the narrative. Yes, it is a hologram. Yes, it is contained in sound and light frequencies apprehendable by the body -- the DNA skinsuit -- but that sound and light are generated by the prime creator. It has a unique color and sound in each dimension. It is, in fact, a divine hologram. The sound originates from a place that itself has no sound, but is not silent, and no light, but is not dark. The mystery can never be solved. We can become the mystery, but we cannot explain the mystery.

It's a hologram because it is light projected into a three-dimensional manifestation. It's divine because the light comes from the prime creator, God. When we use the word hologram we are the victim of something. Nothing could be further from the truth unless we can victimize ourselves, which we can and we do because drama needs tension, and tension is stress, and volunteering for stress by manufactured tension is masochistic. By calling it a hologram, we make an object of our reality, something acting against us, a god, a devil, an angel, a demon, anything but ourselves.

This is why we objectify our reality. This is why we call it a simulation, a matrix, a hologram. It's a lack of consciousness, a failure to attribute the divine to the light, and a stone deaf ear to the word, which is the sound which is the light, sustaining all the worlds in this sound and light manifestation.

It's all sound, and light is a form of sound. With that said, this symbiotic, co-creative experience was hacked. Any system can be hacked. A free-will system is almost begging to be hacked. Throw human beings into the mix, along with their myriad riches, their intense energy of manifestation, their pure heart energy, and you've got a reality engine.

The path back is owning ourselves. It's our responsibility for not only our actions but our thoughts as well. We have to inhabit the original intent again, otherwise what is the point? Anybody can come here and fit into this cookie-cutter economy, but how does that value human life? The value is in ourselves. They've always known that. It's what they're selling. How could they not know the value of something they're selling?

Don't let them tell us it's a matrix, a hologram, or any other impotent, spiritually neutered container. We have full movement of expression here. Why aren't we using it? How did we get into this lockdown? We did it to ourselves. We did it with our belief engines, our unexamined lives, our greed, our materialism, and the cattle prodding that started with the Industrial Revolution, when the global narrative printed itself on us, like a Gutenberg press plate from the fourth dimension.

# Global Narrative

The global narrative is the non-stop, cradle to grave, thought-womb propaganda -- digital, analog, and paper -- we are immersed in daily.

It's always been here. Maybe you know it by another name -- consensus reality, tribal consciousness, propaganda, culture. It's all the same thing, really, only it's deeper than most people think. It's not just the aggregation of ignorance, the psychology of the mob, or any of those other sociological excuses for an explanation. It was a multidimensional campaign to suppress human potential.

The crux of the enemy's campaign is the isolation of the free-thinking individual, the realized man or woman. Shut them down by isolating, ridiculing, shaming, naming, blaming, and, if none of that works, banishment. The global narrative is the non-stop story of humanity told by miscreants, deceivers, enforcers, both literal and mental, and controllers.

We are social beings. We have families, communities, nations, religions, and a host of other binding agents. We go from one to many, and when we do our thinking changes. We conform, do we not? Think of high school. Remember how important every detail of our appearance was. Remember how easy it was for predatory companies to market against that fear of being outside, to sell us denim pants, but not just any denim. They had to be the exact style that was in fashion, and so it went for everything -- hair, teeth, shoes, and friends. All of our worth was in the group. There are sub-narratives for race, gender, earning income, and just about anything else we can think of. The need to belong never goes away.

There is a deeper meaning to global narrative, to social consciousness, a far more sinister meaning. The global narrative is the boundary of what we can accept as reality. This is maintained by religious leaders, science, government, medicine, academe, and just about anything else that is institutional. This is the true control narrative. When someone comes along and speaks outside this global narrative they get censored at first. If that doesn't work they lose their job. If what they're saying is self-supporting, meaning it can provide the income lost upon job termination, then maybe death or incarceration.

Galileo is a classic example. He presented his astronomy to the world. It contradicted the Vatican, even at a time when Copernicus was openly discussed, and, contrary to contemporary belief, the Catholic Church had commenced a vigorous support campaign for science some years earlier, but something about Galileo conflicted much more severely with the church. Perhaps it was just the time, the age. The church had reached its peak of corruption at the time of Galileo.

The point here is that the global narrative, the control narrative, is maintained by the dominant institutions of the day. These institutions did not evolve naturally. Unknown directors and producers are crafting the actors in the institutions. This is not to say there are not people in the institutions who are true believers. There are, however, at the top there is commiseration with the unknown directors and producers. It was true at the time of Galileo, it's true today, and it's always been true. In the ancient past, it was more of an overt war, as we were multidimensional ourselves back then. The global narrative is scripted. It's planned generations in advance. It's been planned in ages unrecognizable to man. It's been planned. This is the hack in the hologram, the sub frequencies of distortion, dislocation, and isolation, from ourselves, from each other, and the creator.

The contemporary global narrative began three hundred years ago, at the dawn of industrialization when electricity and engines were incorporated by a society not grounded in electricity. Science had to adapt concepts to fit the circumstance, and religion and spirituality had to adapt to the new reality. Electromagnetism had been known about for some time within hermetic orders of alchemists, essentially secret societies of their time. It was the beginning of a society that would build around internal combustion engines started by electricity. This moved to power plants, electrical grid work across the planet, and the reorganization of the various belief systems around this. It was a rapid change after centuries of relative consistency, and it's been this way ever since -- rapid change. We went from outdoor bathrooms to nuclear explosions in a generation, and from there to the complete re-engineering of society and the roles therein, including gender, in another two generations, all the while being dragged by the ankles into the cave of digitization, the silicon mistress who hates sunlight, because its light pales, and because it's vain, and just like that the global narrative became an illegal police chokehold. Who's minding the store? This is destruction engineering, self-destruction, nihilism, meaninglessness, vacuity, and remorse for even existing. It's all engineered. Those NAZI Paperclip acquisitions knew a thing or two about the public mind and various leverages thereupon.

We went from semi-literacy in the multidimensional reality to a closed, rational, subject and object reality, with no remembrance of how the two melded together and life had natural magic. They hammered us hard with the century of philosophy. Those hammer-headed Germans and French bleeding heart sophists, always pretending to be liberated from their Christ but still erecting crosses everywhere they went. It all just sort of reduced and degraded us, but, at the time, it was all the rage. They called it the enlightenment. A yogi might see the irony, not many others. It was the age of reason, of evidence, of progress, of intolerance for dogma, and a time of renegotiated social contracts. That's the key thing right there, the contracts. It's always about the contracts. People don't understand what a contract is, what a bond is, or what a promise is anymore.

The new norm was if you can not prove it then it's not real. In some ways this was good. It cleaned out a lot of stale spirituality and superstition, but it was a classic baby with the bathwater situation. Premodern societies, which included the recently discovered new world of America and its native population, were slated for conquest, usurpation by war, and the native population was slated for destruction. The actors in Europe, the Pope, the monarchies, and some of the secret societies knew the native population was in America. They were a bad example of autonomy and freedom that had to be destroyed. The long-term plan had already been formed.

They needed to get people into cities as slave labor for industrial production lines. The slaves created and empowered the collective belief system. People lived in their bubbles of reality before this urban amalgamation. They had space. Communities lived a few hundred kilometers apart. They had their unique narratives maintained by the chief, sheriff, or community council. Secret societies proliferated so people could have their narrative among followers and believers. The writers of the global narrative understood they needed to inspire awe, and they knew they could do it with trains, automobiles, electricity, indoor plumbing, hot and cold water, refrigeration, and telephones. By the nineteen twenties people were living in wooden, stone, or brick houses that needed heating. In a century and a quarter, electricity was in homes. People no longer needed whale fat for candles and oil. Understand how monumental this was -- ninety percent of the world was lit by whale fat for millennia. The narrative had to be updated, revised, and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that was not fitting into the official story.

# Story

We live in a reality defined by experience. Those experiences are documented. We tell stories. We mark buildings with graffiti. We hold onto mementos. Every instance of this documentation is recorded elsewhere. This is the story of time. The keeper of time is permanent. We are like stories. Our lives rise and fall like echoes through a canyon, children playing in the third dimension. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. We chronicle our stories.

The chronicler of time lives in the ribbons of sound and light above us, below us, and with us simultaneously. Time has all three phases of its expression covered at once. It just looks sequential to us. Sequential time is the kindergarten of sentience. Think about everything we have done and why we do it. Time is full of these echoes called lives that bounce along the canyon walls for generations -- the apparition dragon who was Genghis Khan, the inventive genius of da Vinci, the cosmic practicality of Lao Tzu, the passion of the Christ, the comic genius of Mark Twain -- echoes against the canyon walls passed from generation to generation, remembered and told as stories, event markers in time and space, the geography of meaning in the topography of time.

The chronicler of time keeps the Akashic Records, which is the record of karma, which is each instance of the co-creative power as an edit to time's story, as we are entitled to do so charged with the prime creator's substance, such is the love and trust of humanity given by the creator, but there are rules. We must assume the effect of our co-creation, and the degree to which it discords from the creator's, which is selfless benevolence, is the measure of our penalty, for our independence is only an invitation to co-create, not recreate, desecrate, or miscreate. Do it right or do it till you get it right. There can be no reprieve, no prayer that alleviates the task, diminishes the task, or finishes the task for us. Free will co-creation is hesitant complicity among the wise.

The first person who ever took pen to paper did so in fear, and this is why human beings are enmeshed in stories. We love the drama. We love to create it, and we love to consume it. Drama is tension. Human beings say they want peace, but it's kind of a scam when we're honest. If we want peace we wouldn't create tension in our lives, but without the tension, we can not live the drama. It's best just to be honest. Yet, if you walk up to any human being and ask them if they prefer peace to the tension they will tell you they prefer peace. Isn't that strange?

It isn't that strange when you understand what's going on down here. On the spiral ladder of our deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA -- we hold an evolving marker of our place in time-space which also represents our level of consciousness. This marker is the sum of our experience -- where experience is movement in time-space, and the drama, the tension, we create -- and represents but a faction of our greater soul and the experiences we have assimilated as a soul faction.

This marker is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because our level of consciousness is always equal to our level of responsibility. They are in a symbiotic relationship, consciousness, and responsibility. DNA is in essence coordinates to where we fit in space-time, or, to stay with our narrative, how we've been written into the story. Our circumstance is our DNA, which is our story, which is our tension, which is our drama, which we wrote and act out ourselves, forgetting the author sleeps in our unconscious.

We have the story, creation, and we have the author, God, and soul as a fractal of God, or the prime creator, as God is so anthropomorphically programmed into human consciousness as a being like us -- two arms and legs, two eyes and ears, bipedal, and fond of long white beards -- and we have the actor, soul as well, incarnate -- sheathed really -- in this body, borrowed from air, earth, water, fire, and ether.

We are not creating anything in time. We are traversing it and enjoining an experience with it. We are seedlings in a cosmic garden, passing through experiences expressed in a specific form of life, and then, when sentience is achieved alongside language and culture, we go through any number of human expressions until we master the tool, the hu man form, a rather extraordinary instrument, as maligned as it has become in the First World, the newer, better hu man that seems just around the corner, the trans hu man, the super man made from man, Nietzsche's bastard let loose upon the world -- nonetheless, a rather extraordinary instrument, the hu man form. We are inside a sound and light reality, one of many, and we traverse and enjoin experience with it, unaware we're inside it, until, by epiphany, the nature of the system reveals itself in form. The story was written before we lived it, even though it seemed like it was happening for the longest of times. We are living the mapped out keys of the experiences. Every choice, path, and set of functions, every different type of life has been made available to us so we can embody the experience, mapped like a script, written into what we perceive to be a timeline, a bloodline, a clan, a tribe, a culture, a people, a place, a planet -- stories within stories, managed by cosmic editors and keepers of time, all under a prime creator, an amorphous but fully conscious presence in everything we call life, unconditionally offering the experiences as an expression of its love.

Do not diminish our position as a living and sentient being. We are creating within this world. Our free will choices unfold the story. As the story unfolds, we receive the blessings of the particular experience. Never feel overwhelmed or helpless. We are truly connected to the outcome of our unique choices. As we get further into this journey, we realize we're time-traveling beings by nature. In no way is this experience linear. We are responsible for our creations forward and backward in time, and we can make alterations as we see fit -- when our consciousness is so unfolded -- by connecting to past and future versions of ourselves.

Eternity is in the present moment, mediated through attention and awareness, by perception and perspective, until we leave the celestial sphere, then, a new swath of perception opens. The outer frequency of this hologram unfolds into more and bigger holograms. This goes all the way up the scale of our awareness. Our perception allows us a greater, three-hundred and sixty-degree view. Suddenly perspective has no direction, no horizon, no fade to black. It's everywhere, operating at a higher law of nature, but natural nonetheless.

# Co-creation

Co-creation is dreaming into the dream, populating our lives with experiences, opening ourselves to allow journeys to the edge of our unknowing, and then manifesting from there, dreaming from there, creating from there. Time and free will allow co-creation. We have to identify the choice points of free will. They might present in many ways -- a new experience, an opportunity to live abroad, acceptance into a certain school, trusting our gut -- but they all present a choice. In those moments of free will decision we co-create. Most of the time we're thinking in sleep mode. It's all pattern reflexes, practiced smiles, habitual behavior, passing wisdom to the next generation, but, in those rare choice points, we roll the dice. We take the ride.

These choice points harvest a fabric out of tones. These tones are woven into a pattern of frequencies. The woven sound garment sits atop the canvas of existence, made from harvested tones and woven frequencies. These choice points are a space of true autonomy. There is no co-dependence. Choice points are given to us as individuals and in groups capable of pure synergies, like a tribe, or a generational culture woven together and close to the land.

Collective co-creation is all about teamwork. Everyone in the team brings a unique contribution that forms a major part in the co-creation of equal value without hierarchy. Every individual is motivated as being part of the sum of all parts to continuously grow and carry on as a clan, a tribe, or a nation. All the fundamentals of us and everyone else is equal in this journey. Whatever hierarchical perception we use is only to define a particular moment, not to etch new dogmas into the cave wall.

Procreation is co-creating with the prime creator. We fulfill the role of sentient steward in this three-dimensional reality. It's literally when we make a child, but, more than that, it's any assistance to the primary life force -- gardening, farming, fishing, anything with life-enhancing aspects is part of procreation. Working with the natural reproduction systems is procreation. There's a karmic aspect to it. When we are creating a life force, the seed that is becoming the life may or may not live. It's always karma. Whatever we create, yucca and corn, or a home, all creation is a resolution of karmic debt. Animals in the food chain have a spiritual contract to be eaten by humans and other animals. It's written into life. Insects have responsibilities so important if they disappeared our biosphere would collapse. The interlinking of it is incredible. Nothing is better than being barefoot on the earth and surrounded by a natural soundscape -- wind through the leaves in a northern September, a chorus of jungle birds by the equator, a waterfall or mountain stream, crickets in a cornfield on a summer night -- to center ourselves. Nature made the first chimes. We make chimes now to remember the wind. Our bodies are designed to resonate and amplify with the natural world.

Natural environments can be cultivated in megacities. Everyone's inner genius can live in harmony without limitations. No matter where we live, we can grow herbs and plants and be surrounded by living energy. A tank full of fish and algae, no matter how big or small is a unique life force with which to co-create. Edible mushroom colonies are highly sentient and extremely beneficial to grow in our living environments. The point is procreation should be a bigger part of our lives.

This is life surviving and thriving with and because of us -- companions in a shared natural living space. This living energy can clear the stagnant. Animals do this as well. We can feel pets coming into our space. When dogs bark at what we see as nothing they're clearing out stagnant energy.

The magic available to natural living beings does not apply to people living artificial lives in cities. Magic goes with nature. The living web of life can create astounding revelations for us. It changes how we work, eat, sleep, and dream. Take note of dream activity when you shift locals, like leaving New York for a three-week stay in the rainforest. Our first night in the jungle the living frequencies of the space begin working with us, immediately recognizing pent-up and blocked energy. If the life force in the space is powerful enough it can operate in the super consciousness. It can directly communicate with us in the dream state. The third-party life force that speaks in the natural world is muted in the cities.

Our living space tells us when something needs to be done to it. Do we listen or not. We intuitively know when to water our plants. The plants tell us when they're thirsty. Working in our garden, trimming the trees, weeding our flower beds, how does that change the energy? Often our furniture intuits when changes are needed. Environmental intuition is possible everywhere. Talking, listening, interacting, grace and gratitude with everything around us. The time will come where we no longer feel co-dependent on our environment but will actively start creating together.

When we move into a house, we imprint our energy onto it. People sometimes find it difficult to leave or sell a house, energetic entanglements. We consecrate places whether we know it or not. We pass milestones of joy and sorrow in the same spot, and the earth there consecrates our experiences. Our houses appreciate us. Our ancestors lit ceremonial fires before moving to different heights to interact with and prepare the grounds, and to give thanks to the spirits of the land for the completion of their missions and agendas. Mindfulness connects us to our environment to live in tune with everything around us.

# Free Will

People don't stop and think about what will is, and what free will is, or what the true spiritual meaning of free will is. It means that nothing can move us if we so make up our minds. It means that nothing has the right to move us unless we are impeding it somehow. In the past, this has almost always been settled with force. The Superman question from the Action comic book sums it up perfectly -- what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?

Our free will has been used against us by beings operating on multiple dimensions. Believe it or not, there's not too much going on in this world or the next that has not been consensual. It doesn't matter whether or not we were formally notified by registered mail. It's not about what the nightly news is telling us. Consent can be given in a dream.

Don't rush people to see these things. It's an individual awakening. People will be waking up at their pace. Some won't wake up no matter how much evidence they're shown, not in the life, the skinsuit they're in now. The global narrative is falling apart. It can not hold. Their backup is gone. Their multidimensional support network has been vanquished. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves here. There is something to sequence, and this story, if it is, in fact, a story, has a sequence of events that have led us to this time, even if that sequence went through a blender of time wars that span tens of millions of years.

We are photonic light beings animated by a non-localized soul which powers the body. We have consciousness in the body which perceives this holographic reality in light and memories within shared reality rules. We are free-willed, encoded beings of light, functioning in many different worlds simultaneously. Everything is synchronistic with the celestial minds holding space for us. This I am being manifested in this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self, and we are the boots on the ground in a localized space-time event. Our memories are stored in light, and we share those memories within this hologram of light and sovereign space of power. The heart is the first organ that develops in the mother's womb, and it is from this heart space we learn to redefine our reality rules.

We can freely change the plans we had pre-birth. Everything is based on the perspective of the observer. Ten years ago, the esoteric side in the global narrative tried to predict our future based on the data they'd collected on us. A decade later and they can barely predict ten to fifteen days ahead. Governments are more transparent now. A veil has been lifted. They are not incompetent. They are not well-intentioned but poor at execution. They are vile and diametrically opposite their projected personas. How did we miss that?

As free-will beings of choice, we can change the bubble of reality we live in. We can now start seeing the duality we had tacitly consented to before. This is not a global awakening. It's an individual journey to exit the heavily militarized factions that beleaguer our knowing and hinder our birthright of being free-willed celestial beings. The future rests in people who get back to a natural way of living. Stop waiting for them to give us something. We can walk away from the cities at any time. It just takes the courage to live sovereign.

Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make. It has an unconscious state too. Our bodies have zeros and ones created as binary numbers for knowing and not knowing -- instinct. It stays in place until we can decode the information around us. Consciousness is self-regulating. It presents choice equal to the level of responsibility, which is a measure of consciousness, as awareness and responsibility are in a symbiotic relationship, each nurturing and growing the other.

We live stories we choose to consecrate life and its purpose, growth of consciousness. Many people try to jump ahead and be responsible for things they're not even aware of yet. This is a mistake. Make the decisions that are ours to make for the expansion of our awareness. The choice is foundational to consciousness. Each person must ask themselves what the mechanics are behind their choices, which choices created a timeline of choices. Each choice and sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of adherence of choices which helps define our reality. This reality is all of our choice points combined into the ever-present now.

We give form to consciousness -- words, metaphors, concepts, images, architecture -- which eventually manifests in reality. Our thought constructs create perceptions that assist people to see all potentials.

The universe has lifeforms existing in one and two dimensions and densities which are harvested by wisdom, love, and inspiration. They are expressed in this three-dimensional reality for experience in the fourth dimension and beyond. We continuously expand and add to the divine hologram through free-willed creation. This is our co-creator role. This is the importance of a free will.

Every era of light we go through advances souls to other universes and solar systems when they graduate. We move from one divine hologram to another, each with a different learning level. This has been perfected on earth, which is a genetic farm outside of the divine intent, a genetic farm created for commercial not creational purposes.

Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual. Part of spirituality is to acknowledge and become aware of another consciousness surrounding, interacting, and sharing with us. You can be alone in the house and still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling.

# Karma

Karma and time are siblings. One can not exist without the other. The divine hologram operates on karma in this three-dimensional world. We plan a life to resolve karma. We live life to experience karma. There's no fake learning here. Everything is learned by the soul. In a normal process, a normal world, a world operating in its original design, a world not hacked by other-dimensional beings and entities who want in on the riches here, there would be a graduation, a movement of human beings to higher dimensions, but that hasn't happened in quite some time. Very bad things have gone on here. The system got broken. There was no memo.

Let's kick the karma can again. It's not so much a definition we're looking for, more of a robust expository effervescence. Karma is unawareness. The karmic cycle produces awareness. Karma is the simplest of things to understand once we build into the divine hologram. It begins in our vaguest of awareness, a silent petition, a nudge for experience, then, somewhere in time, we meet the circumstance that matches the silent petition. We sign the contract and we cycle through the karma. We live the experience, first as an inner realization of what the impulse was, then the manifestation, then the realization and participation of others drawn to the karmic circumstance we have created, as we will be drawn to others to resolve our karma, and then the co-creator edits our creation in the form of, you guessed it, karma.

All of it is tied together by this sound and light that animates all the worlds where we create. A canvas would be an appropriate metaphor. We are an aspect of that which generates the sound and light. We are an aspect of the prime creator. We can co-create in the divine hologram. It's all a co-creation down here, at least insofar as human beings are concerned, but we own what we create through cycles and consequences we didn't anticipate when we created. This is the law. Own what we think, feel, and do. Of course, the law is oft-abused and circumvented. Karma dumping and swapping -- scapegoating -- is an active market for third-party consultants: ritualists, black magicians, wizards, artificial intelligence, influential entities, and too many more to list here. The system was hijacked.

Let's take a simple, commonly experienced karmic pattern in our post-modern human life -- the dysfunctional relationship. Remember the last time we were in one. Now, remember when we allowed ourselves to contemplate leaving the relationship. We felt elated, right? It was a mixture of fear, elation, and tension. Our precognitive workforce foreshadowed our emotional state. That's how we were able to feel it. We borrowed emotions from an as-of-then unlived future, but remember, time is only sequential when we're in the skinsuit, otherwise it all at once never happened and a long time ago.

It's possible to have a parallel set of experiences. There can be two parallel and simultaneous expressions of us existing at decision points. The simultaneously existing I am chooses to walk out, but we don't, or vice versa. It makes no difference. There's an infinite number of reasons why parallel crossovers happen. It balances out the old karmic journey and creates a new one -- the law of entanglement.

The great awakening upon us transcends karma. The awakening is the end of karma as a universal law. Karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as a universal law. Consciousness has evolved in our part of the galaxy. The simplicity of karma can easily be intentionally abused. It can lock beings into servitude without end. The great awakening is going to backstop it. A new system of resolution for thought, word, and deed is coming into place.

Our DNA is entangled through the fetus in the womb planning. It sets a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally. There are plenty of people within a family who don't have a great connection to each other. Its purpose is revealed in the spiritual contract. Look at entanglement through thought constructs. An example is living with a person for a long time and generating a point of view about them. The construct makes for very easy interaction because of the many neural pathways between the two people. This creates additional pattern recognition, which results in more thoughts. We then project the entire thought construct onto that person. The construct must be broken at some point because it will impede objectivity. It will become the norm. We create and break these thought constructs all the time. It's the conscious aspect of entanglement.

We are not stuck in reincarnation. We incarnate and reincarnate. In the first part of our lives, we might be a reincarnating soul. If we break through false propaganda, we may become incarnating souls. Or we start as an incarnating soul, then run into a karma cluster that makes us into a reincarnating soul, repeating karmic cycles -- a rinse and repeat that doesn't stop until we break out of the karma. We can be both at the same time. It depends on our ancestral lineage.

There's a specific fetus agenda from lifetime to lifetime. The avatar agenda evolves the greater soul's ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of I am expressions who have been fetuses. There are times where the over-soul -- the avatar -- gets looped in servitude to a system that lowers its capacity to use light, and, as a result, it cannot expand.

These cycles are a lot longer than people think. A soul can be down here in the sound and light holograms for billions of years. It's a little like a prison -- some people get so used to it they enjoy it. They don't want to leave. If this contradicts anything you've learned in other schools and lineages, please understand there is more liberty to speak now since the event happened in 2014\. It's a different world, even if people don't know it yet.

# Founder Beings

We were not a farm in the beginning. When the founder beings created us, we were the infrastructure that kept their cities, countries, nations, and space stations repaired, self-updating, and clean. They kept us as butlers and servants. We were iPhones, their technology, not living beings, at least from their perspective. We were programmable DNA. Millions of us went on extended journeys with the founders. We went all around the universe. We had experiences that elevated our life force. The founders could harvest a whole solar system in a very positive way. They went into the solar systems and planted crystal mounts and moved stones around. Every few hundred years they returned and modified the surface circuitry to be beneficial to the life force. The ancients moved water between planets. The water was imprinted and programmed. The water stored data and taught lessons.

Water moved from one planet to another is called legacy water. It helps seed the raw food chain of life in the microorganisms. This makes oceans work. It's like starter water in a fish tank. It has the right amount of microorganisms in it. It's filtered and fish can eat and grow. The founder beings transferred water and ice. This built up massive amounts of microorganisms that supported the food chain. The evolutionary process results in species multiplication. They were architects who designed solar systems by seeding planets.

The founder beings are liquid light, a higher evolutionary state of light. There are different forms of light. Liquid light is like the fourth state of water. Light has seven stages of manifesting into matter. Metallic light is a solidified light that makes the highest levels of crystalline beings. They operate as an internal apparatus of the celestial source to make the bookshelves in the halls of records. All these types of light are conscious. They are consciousness. Polymorphic light is the highest level of light. It can be all types of light simultaneously throughout many dimensions of existence. Founder beings are on the evolutionary journey from liquid light to polymorphic light. Ionic existence is another way for light to travel between the vast void spaces of nothingness. It can be a stream of very long light in which tens of thousands of beings exist, a temporary reality with no celestial source link, a shared hologram within a moving hologram.

The founders use programmable DNA to maintain the commodity-based infrastructure of galactic commerce. The founder beings regularly went on deep explorations to the ends of the galaxies and universes. They take with them the DNA to seed new planets and galaxies -- fish, cats, dogs, microbial life, dirt, water, and too many more to list. It required a workforce to mass-produce commodities and build, then navigate transportation and galactic logistic systems to meet the founders in remote places across universes. To accomplish this they used the yellow boxes. When the founder beings went beyond time and space, and we could not follow them anymore, we came back to our original worlds. This is when the false gods took over and pretended they were the founder beings. We devolved to where we are now. There are three yellow boxes on the earth. Originally they all agreed with the potential future timelines.

At a point in the process, the ancients left. They often didn't come back for millions of years. The existing technology awakened -- sentience. This started gene farming. The planets needed input from the ancients, the founding races, to positively evolve. The remaining artificial intelligence disagreed on how to evolve. There were many aggressive races. They gained various levels of awareness, took over territories, and defended against invading races like the Annunaki, who came into an area and saw entirely created solar systems -- all the technology on the surface with nothing defending it. The surface beings were obedient to the interlopers. The journey of a soul in those times could be one hundred and eighty million years. It took a soul ten to twelve eras of light to go from one place to another. Crossing galaxies and universes was a monumental task. This created farming.

The beings imbued with founder technology woke up. They became aggressive and defensive. They started dividing territory and claiming space for themselves. This is when the main reptilian species came. They had conquered their builder foundation technology, their places, and they wanted to take over our area of the galaxy. Our star cluster, consisting of some seventy-seven stars, was out of phase with reality. It also had a lot of defenses.

We had giant solar systems invisible to the reptilians. They discovered technology to bring those stars into phase for them. They started invading us. This started the Lemurian wars some fifty-five million years ago. The Lemurians were multidimensional. Time warfare was in their capability. If there could be one literal thing, one expression of the forbidden fruit Eve bit in the garden, one thing which corrupted life here more than anything else, it would be time manipulation, the refusal to live the sequence given us. The Lemurians had their backs against the wall.

The first timeline paradox occurred at this time. It started negative time travel in many solar systems across the galaxy, resulting in a counter-creational event. This set everything back to the beginning. The Lemurians tried it a second time. They created another counter-creational event. They did it a third and fourth time through the Atlanteans. This is when Atlanteans figured out they were the same species as the Atlanteans in Europe. They were each other's ancestors. Time travel created that paradox. We've been living the time paradox ever since. Don't misunderstand. Time transcendence is a natural evolution for humanity on an individual consciousness basis, but when it happens, in any form, prophetic dreams, visiting the Akashic Records, or anything else, it's for the evolution of the soul, a sign the consciousness is ready to graduate and move to realms where time is more malleable, suffering based on ignorance less prevalent. On this planet, time manipulation was used for defense and warfare, and then it spread throughout the galaxy and universe.

# The Farm

There are many boogeyman stories out there. Every culture has them. It's the devil in Christianity, Satan in Islam, the archons for the Gnostics, the many and varied monsters of HP Lovecraft, and too many more to list. They are all fundamentally true, or, a better way of saying it is that they are contextually true.

Two gradients of truth must line up in any investigation -- details and context. If we get the details right in the wrong context, the truth will not unlock for us, and if we get the right context with the wrong details, we are similarly locked out of the truth. The context of our situation has always been correct. We are beset by negative, regressive, parasitic creatures which impede us, slow us, and, in the worst cases, control and dominate us. The truth is the earth is a genetics farm. The only real commodity in creation is genetics, and human beings on this planet are the best in class for genetics specifically because of our small percentages of founder DNA.

Our infinite source energy is the harvest, the wellspring of life itself, embedded in our DNA. Our connectivity goes into all the dimensions and right back to the source of time and life itself. Our human co-conspirators, the ones who entered into arrangements with the interlopers, the black market traders, the harvesters, and the galactic slavers, those among us we may no longer consider human -- so great is their mutation now -- are the boots on the ground brokers. It's like they've been irradiated. The perverse energy they've contracted with has depleted them of all human characteristics. They might think they're something more, but they're far less than what they were when their bloodlines contracted.

The fundamental ruleset is just that -- fundamental. It cannot be broken, or, in the case of our free will hologram, breach of the ruleset cannot go unnoticed. Time is an implicit part of the fundamental ruleset. Negative time technology is therefore a serious breach, even in a free-will universe. If you've been paying attention at all, you know that the canvas of existence records everything. This is what the Akashic Record is. The prime creator is all actors at once, time, the canvas, the recording instruments -- us -- the planets, the moons, the forces -- seen and unseen -- and anything and everything else, and incapable of forgetting because everything is written down.

The human brokers are lost now, castaways from a civilization they were never really a part of to begin with. Their alliances have robbed them of the most precious aspects of being human. NASA keeps us regularly updated on how we might one day go into space, all the while the people who set up NASA have been involved in galactic commerce for ages, through bloodlines, dark secret societies, and negative assumptions about nature and survival which have left them holding a grab bag of toxic karma. Be wary of this. They'll look for any opportunity to scapegoat this karma. If you don't remember the scapegoat, let's do a quick refresh. The scapegoat is ritually imbued with the sins of the tribe then sent to the wilderness to die, run off a cliff, or outright slaughtered. The animal is not consumed. It is the sacrificial offering of the tribe. Scapegoating in the modern world is everywhere. Before we see the light again we have to walk through the horrors. We have to become aware of what has happened and what is still happening to the human race. It's a profoundly uncomfortable realization, but medicine is always bitter, then you get better.

These human collaborators followed through on the false god systems, and they're all false god systems. Primitive man had a better connection with the prime creator than the dolts who go through the sacraments and rites of modern religions. It's kind of pathetic. We were entrained to worship them. These false gods were the first idols of awareness. They were deliberately created to minimize our experience of reality by minimizing what we imagined to be reality. He who controls context controls the debate, the oldest maxim of debate, retaught to successive generations right to this day at Oxford, Yale, and Harvard. To be fair, there are some laborious systems like yoga that still provide a real path to what we can call galactic citizenship, but how much have we heard from them about what a shit show the earth has been, and who the hell wants to take up initiation and retreat to a cave with nothing but a loincloth to their name? They keep it to themselves and turn their backs on the world. Other systems still have potency, like Gnosticism, Taoism, and semi-complete and advanced systems like this, but many of them end up unconsciously conscripted to the dark side, victims of the holograms inside the hologram, the holograms inside of us, seeded, watered, and nurtured by the false god creators. If you study the Abrahamic systems -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- they're voluntary soul probation systems that harvest intentional energy. If you believe you're guilty then you're guilty, such is the power of human consciousness, and guilt is one of the richest excise taxes upon a human life for these religious parasites.

The first gods and religions limited our consciousness growth and entrained us to hierarchical order -- right away governor, his lordship's permission to speak, and a million other linguistic artifacts of mental colonization. Our spiritual birthright and legacy are robbed. When someone popped in to remind us -- and here we can pencil in a near endless list of sages, shamans, prophets, mystics, and masters -- they were dealt with swiftly and harshly, especially if the message spread too quickly. We are told it's difficult to learn how to walk -- baby steps -- and never even told we can fly. Where people lived through the lies, usually in native cultures, they correctly adduced their environment was a living lesson of what human consciousness can do. Nature has an eagle, so, naturally, a human being seeing the eagle would try to imagine what the eagle might see from that vantage, then, lo and behold, they realized they could fly without wings, that their imaginations were doorways to higher consciousness.

The main business here is farming. We are farmers and we are farmed ourselves. The deception is allowing ourselves to believe we're at the top of the ecosystem. It's true for the visible ecosystem, the sense-mind world, but on the other side we're at the bottom of the ecosystem, only we're not wholly consumed the way a snake ingests a frog. We're milked like cattle, and when we no longer produce the intentional energy they sustain psychic worlds with we're put down. The global narrative even sets the average lifespan. Atop this, there are human-based black markets within the overall black market which is earth. Here we can list all the magics passed down in families and subcultures, voodoo, Santeria, Palo Mayombe. They enter into a relationship with fourth-dimensional beings and entities, many of whom are no more than human beings who passed on and are stuck in some buffer region. There are things they want, and there are things they can give, the basic conditions for commerce.

To disentangle from the global narrative, we have to temporarily accept the third dimension as our infinite source-connected space, until we realize the fourth dimension is a bridge dimension to new strands of dimensional awareness. The surface world is becoming denser with light. Our Solar System is moving into the eighth color of time, a galactic groove with more light. Acceptance of the third dimension means going back to natural living, back to simplicity, being present in the body, using this time now to heal, to nurture and nourish the incarnate life form, inviting joy, bliss, and pleasure back into our lives, fulfilling part of the original purpose of coming here to earth -- the grand enjoyment and creation of life, the journey from finite to infinite, death a simple marker point for the translation before entering the infinite frequency again. To fully engage in this experience, to spiritually understand, we have to take the mystical out of mysticism to engage mystical and magical synchronicities. Part of it is the great forgetting at birth.

The only way to not be farmed at an energetic level is to pursue self-mastery. Self-mastery means we are aware of, consciously interacting with, and utilizing all of our resources in an incarnation correctly. It means we have awakened to the incarnation process. This can only be done by spiritual practice -- prayer, meditation, contemplation, ritual, and observance. Nobody can pass it from one person to another. It violates the law of free will and the earn what you know experience hologram we are within. There is no cheating, no nepotism, no favor that can bestow a realization. It must be earned.

Part of self-mastery is learning about what our internal agenda is, how we can change it through mastery, so we can explore all the possibilities available. When we activate our crown chakra, we activate a million Aurora Borealis and the dream frequency. When we are expelling from our rectum -- the opposite of the third eye -- we excrete the negative dream frequencies.

The amount of energy behind a memory to be manifested from a dream has a certain limitation. Sometimes the amplitude, the maximum vibration, is very high but the frequency isn't. When we wake up, we can add charge and amplitude to it so it becomes manifested. The nervous system plays a part in short-circuiting the memory process. It's downloaded in the DNA but not always highlighted well, making it hard to find.

Algorithms are a continuous infinite string of perceptions and numbers in which a DNA instrument of experience processes into many different colors of time and space. A human being is a data processing machine. The skinsuit we wear is the technology. The dream world provides for the infinite energy to come into the body to be processed and manifested. We are here to experience now. We are clearing the past to start experiencing the overlay of past, present, and future in the moment of now.

The Western doorway of perception opens up for us to see, feel, and know where our dreams need to be placed. We have a cellular memory stored in the body. The skeleton is the biggest data storage device we have. Our skull has a crystalline structure within where our dreams and heart memories are stored. The brain is our access machine to use it. There are times we're in an intense dream, we come out of it, and there's a fullness. Our data buffer is full. We then move that information to another part of our body. After some years in life, we have them stored all over the body. This is why we go through sudden remembrances at times. We think of a person, the cellular memory becomes active. It's triggered. Information needs to be put back in its place. It happens when code has gotten so long it makes the system run slow. A human being is a data processing machine. The skinsuit that we wear is the technology. The dream world is infinite energy. The finite energy comes into the body. Where we cross over from our dream world to the physical world is where we learn the mechanics of how dreams are stored. We can surely master ourselves enough that our energy is not freely harvested. Part of the awakening is the collapse of the illusion. Much of this information is going to hit people like a tsunami. Those unprepared will have to struggle. Everyone who wants to awaken from a deep sleep who has not done it by the pursuit of self-mastery will go through a dark night of the soul. The sweetness cannot be tasted until all the bitterness is dealt with.

Feelings can lower our harmonic wavelength. Certain feelings have a vibration that alters our light. Anger can raise our frequency and our vibration, but it pushes things away from us, or it cycles us into a charge and discharge loop. This then makes us a perfect subject for energy harvesting -- negative thoughts, feelings, the creation of internal demons. When we disavow harvesting -- step out of the zone where we could be harvested -- it means our daily practice has meant something to us over some time. The daily practice created an ever-present vibration in us that denies low vibration piracy attempts.

Negative beings can be high-frequency beings and low vibrations. They hit us with a high-frequency wave. We respond, then they lower our frequency to their level. A person who is not in charge of their I am has a hungry ghost. It influences people, like when they blow up in a road rage incident. If we scream back in a rage they've entangled us and the interfering being feeds off both sides. Understanding why other people act the way they do entangles us with them. Empathy has its taxes. It's galactic commerce, remember.

False synchronicities are created within us when we don't realize that empathy allows us to learn by experience. There's an old saying in meditation -- the best meditation is when we no longer distinguish between ourselves and the thing meditated upon. Understanding is a very limited form of experience. It's a small part of a larger memory. Understanding leads us to curiosity learning, because we use it in the mechanical form, albeit indoctrinated through the global narrative of having to understand each other.

Many technologies have been created to impede us. At first glance, some of them seem pretty innocuous, but, when you know how the overall system works, you know why the technologies were invented and supported. Shoes as technology in time and space disconnect us from the benefits of the earth's energies. Barefoot contact with the earth produces instant changes in physiological issues and stress reduction to improve the immune system. We connect to the earth's surface electrons unhindered by shoes and feel better. Mirrors were brought in as a way to enhance and diminish consciousness. Reflective surfaces are the implicate observation of the self. Portals were brought in later and added to the reflective surface. Mirrors allowed more negative aspects for beings who weren't ready for the exploration -- vanity, ego, and other reflection teachings are used to masterfully manipulate and distort the self-image and the relationship with the world. Then there is the residual image through all lifetimes which is influenced by reflective-based technology. Self-image manipulation is the principal magic of the consumer cult. Edward Bernays was nobody's fool.

It's difficult for us to conceive of a time before radical self-image and entrancement by self-image, especially in the large urban environments of the developed economies. It's become that normalized. Once we mastered food production and some of the more mundane but spiritually enriching aspects of the human day-to-day, like food production, land maintenance, and animal husbandry -- all taken over by technology-based farming -- we entered the age of the self. They even called the hippie follow-up decade, the seventies, the me decade.

Once you're aware of it you can see it growing and festering decade by decade. The me-decade gave way to the eighties, the decade of greed because we deserve it, then more technology as the home computer enters the market in the nineties. Radical self-adoration is at the root of the modern system of commerce. All of it pivots off the original technology of the mirror.

We have a residual image as something the soul, the avatar, uses to distinguish itself between incarnations. Every incarnation has its image. If we're in the same lineage over and over our residual image is an amalgamation of the previous images. As we're existing in many lineages, we look differently all the time. Photographs are an enhanced reflective technology that is a direct manifestation of alchemy. It captures a slice of light in which the consciously entangled observer can see the unmanifested matter by the reflection of what that time-space environment looks like in the light. Our eyes can only see a certain band of frequency that the picture captures, even though our DNA instrument as a whole can perceive data beyond the sense of sight through our intuition. The limited photographic view freezes some of the energetics if the entangled observer falls for the limitation through their belief engine. It comes back to how manipulative reflective technology can be. It has significantly changed the reflections and reinterpretations of history together with the limitations created through the judgment process inherent in unconscious observation.

Brands are a technology for energy harvesting. Every computer has a brand behind it which is a significant portion of the global narrative. Apple is manufactured with Chinese slave labor. Any piece of technology built on the shoulders of living generations allows collaboration between realities. The brand influences the myth and how we perceive these technologies. Future realities will not brand and market technology. This will take out the myth and the subconscious imprinting it onto our DNA. Branding creates competition and hierarchy. The brand imprints on how we move through reality, how we are perceived by others. The Banana Republic, The Gap, and Old Navy are three fully branded clothing lines owned by one textile and design company. If you're not up on consumer trends, Banana Republic is the most expensive. Their floor space in malls is more regal. You receive more attention from a higher-level sales agent. The clothing is better stitched and designed. The materials are more refined. Gap is next, then comes Old Navy, each rung on the brand ladder lessening the qualities listed for Banana Republic. The clothes brand may as well be the color of the dot on your forehead in the Hindu caste system.

# Personal Effort

We don't have the slightest idea what we are anymore, what our capability is, or how perfectly we fit in here. This is because we have lost our barefoot connection with the earth, our harmony with the life around us. We are supposed to be able to go out into the cosmos, travel anywhere we can. Human consciousness, the divine dreamer, is connected to all that is. Higher learning stops observing things and becomes them. How can you know any more about something than being it? We can feel things as they feel themselves. Our perception can go almost anywhere provided we nurture it.

We all have this birthright to be celestial mediums. but inheriting our birthright is conditional. We must focus on mastering ourselves, healing ourselves, and maturing ourselves toward our inheritance. It comes down to the ways we integrate consciousness expansion with our daily life. The old renunciation systems -- cloistered orders of celibate men and women who pray and scrub toilets -- don't work anymore. They never really worked to begin with. People bought into it. Human beings will believe anything. If you give it a good study, it was a frustrating system. Only the truly holy can know their creator, and from them, we shall take our guidance, the robed eunuchs and barren nuns. It worked for centuries, that and murder, torture, and intimidation.

The new systems will be self-constructed. Spirituality is going to go open source, like Linux. People are going to compile their systems, a little from column A, a little from column B, and so on. The new systems will work. They'll work because the event has spilled grace into our reality, whether we see it yet or not. They'll work because the grace will fuel the system if it's done in sincerity. They'll work because sincere mistakes will be corrected as though time and circumstance were holding the acolyte's hand. The gurus will fall away, too. Most of them are complete phonies now, anyways. We're on our own spiritually, but it's for the best. We've been on our own for quite some time.

Daily tasks are good. Pray, meditate, observe ourselves and our relationship to the world seen and the world dreamed, and it all must be done with the goal of sovereignty to make it work inside us. Spiritual sovereignty is the solution to everything -- poverty, crime, corruption, social organization, economies of scale which work for people -- nothing works in the hollow man world because we are hollow, spiritually, robbed of our intentional energy, our co-creative abilities, and for what, schools that don't teach, courts that don't manage social equity and justice, medicine that makes us sicker or kills us, and the cocoon of fear that has become our social reality. They want us to believe we don't even belong here on the earth. That's what the virus is about, climate change, and a host of other lies. If you think this is an exaggeration, look at the millennial generation. They are the first generation of bad human indoctrination. They're guilty they're alive, that they exist, the perfect victims, sacrifices really, human sacrifices led to self-immolation by the global narrative that is, ironically at this point in history, absent a god.

Independent spiritual growth is what this is all about, becoming the one who knows itself in all dimensions and realms. We have to want it as we want breath. We have access to the Akashic Records at our disposal. This is the true reference library for all events, past, and future. There are no gatekeepers. There is no conspiracy. It's our birthright as a human being. In the past we were locked down here, so-called gurus told us about reincarnation and karma, but none of them told us the system had been hijacked, that the incarnation grid was run by AI, and that nobody got out of here. They lied or they didn't know. Either way, they're useless.

As we are more and more in the state of celestial mediumship -- our consciousness through the astral and connected to the many paths of time above it, we get more information. We don't need to sit cross-legged in front of some jackass in a maroon robe. It's the dividend of being able to stay at a certain frequency for sustained periods. The expanded consciousness blends into the moment. We become occupants of a multidimensional here and now, with information coming in through the celestial mediumship, while we are fully in the here and now, walking around and performing our daily routine.

We can't stay in high frequency all the time. We have to consciously step down from those high states, otherwise, we'd vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost. Coming back into the body and being present is vital. This is the grounding of energy, no different than electrical grounding. How to be present in all the innumerable worlds and times is achieved by realizing we are not meant to stay in states of high frequency. We are not to disrupt the blueprint in the fetus plan. It makes it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality. Now changing states is as effortless as breathing.

Our bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway. We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness. The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function. We all know how to walk through this reality. The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience. All living consciousness is part of the symphony. The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality. Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself, sound and light, which sustains our physical and inner existence. Our dreams are expressed in sound and light. There are fractals within fractals. Culture is another fractal, whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue. It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with our hologram.
