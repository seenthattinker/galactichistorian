# Fifty Million Years

We are a one hundred percent free-will universe. That's no small thing, but because we have nothing to compare it to, nothing to create a contrast so we might see the form and blessing of free will in its proper context, we don't understand it. Humanity has been given free will on earth and in the whole universe. It's not common. Most universes are not free will.

What is free will? Free will means we can set up our realities based on rules we create in the free-will universe. Rules agreed upon are rules to follow. The growth of consciousness in the awakening journey expands upon the understanding and blessing of free will. When we become the celestial medium, we see a world of people walking into walls and saying someone or something struck them. That's how badly free will and the inherent aggregated karma have blinded humanity. It's like watching people drive blindfolded at rush hour.

Earth had drama while it was being created. Drama is natural. It adds tension to our lives. We love drama. It turns out a lot of other beings out there do as well. It's like a little charge in us. Look at the mating rituals of humanity, pure drama. Contested courtship can get bloody, then, when we get what we wanted, we question whether we ever even really wanted it. One moment we're ready to kill for something, the next it's last year's birthday present, and we're already generating dramatic tension for our next acquisition, bored with what we have already fought to attain. We're like self-loathing gods, unsure of our jurisdiction or role here while we're alive.

People have an ego, even at the higher dimensions. It just functions differently. When karma reaches the point where a sentient species can reach out several galaxies beyond their home planet, we can create karmic pollution to newer planets, younger planets. Earth was a planet that brought good and bad pollution to thousands of worlds. At inception as a seventh-dimensional galactic seed planet, earth's purpose was to have chakras on its planet called wombs, like a woman's womb. Anyone who lived above the womb chakra would have their sentience influenced to create DNA wisdom.

Fifty-one million years ago, the earth had already been ripped out of its home galaxy. The original dark forces who invaded from a warring galaxy came here, saw the earth, and said, _that's the prize_. All these other little planets were nothing to them. They captured the earth by spiritual invasion. This happens at the astral level. The incarnation process is hijacked by astral beings who did not originate here, resonate with earth, or add anything beneficial. They were brought here to demoralize and degrade the earth. They outbred the people already here in the astral-physical earth by creating more corrupted souls. What ensued was political devastation, land devastation, and dramatic wars with other places. Finally, a core group of dark beings emerged who took over the chakra system and the unity consciousness drive of earth. They teleported earth against its will to the _other_ galaxy.

The first teleportation greatly injured earth. She was near death. Earth cried out to the universe and beyond for help. Massive migrations from the seven universes came to earth. They outbred the dark forces, kicking them off, but they still had the first interlinking of the anchor societies here. When the earth began its healing process -- the dinosaur age -- sentience had been removed from the surface. It was brought into an ethereal realm so the surface could graduate. The surface we live on is the graduating timeline. If we're here to become a higher dimensional soul and enter function with earth, or go out and explore space with our consciousness, we have to be on the graduating timeline. Earth has three timelines -- above, below, and center. Center is the graduating timeline.

At this point, earth kicked off its first defense campaign. We reinforced the energies of the earth. We knew the spiritual invasion was coming again. It was only a matter of when in the timeline. This began the first pyramids to amplify the consciousness of earth after being ripped out of its original galaxy. The pyramids were placed on the chakra points based on the crustal points. They enforced the ability for the local sentience to create local realities. They made a grid around the earth. Any entering entity was screened to determine if it could make spiritual contracts with earth sentience. At that point, the dark forces had spread to a few thousand other worlds. They became more practiced in dominating, controlling, and mastering less evolved species.

The dark ones discovered earth would go through very light, very dark, and very dense periods in its galactic rotation. The dense spots were the place, the time marker, where they could spiritually invade _en masse_, lower the consciousness of the surface people by influencing DNA, soul families, soul contracts, getting us at every stage of the game, ultimately to remove how we naturally lived with our planet. We were disconnected from our ability to communicate and commune with the source.

There are nine layers of pyramids. Earth has been moved twelve times, captured twelve times. There are nine layers of fortification in the astral world. There's no other planet in the universe or three other universes that has been fortified this much. We're in a situation where the dark ones captured earth four to five times, then the light forces recaptured her four to five times, and on like this, a galactic soap opera. We have arrived at a situation where the fortification grid and quarantine put in place by the good guys is now the hindrance. We're a race with amnesia and we're a race held hostage, preyed upon by entities that want to take the powerful people somewhere else by their own belief.

We're entering another one of those periods, a harvest period, so to speak, or ascension, as some circles call it. We're going out of a very dense part and going into a very light part. Of the sixty-six planets in our solar system, the vast majority are in the light part of space. Earth and Mars are stuck in the dense part, anchored by the low consciousness people here. They anchor us here.

Our solar system has many salvage species visiting due to the ample ship debris from past wars. Things don't decay in space. A million-year-old ship would still have many valuable commodities. There are fifty million years worth of treasure in our solar system. Many races who get lured in, even on the astral, end up attached to the intense drama and gravity here and get sucked into the incarnation process here. The near-endless drama of free will subverted and restored has been the history of earth for all these many years, the prize of this solar system, this galaxy, this universe, and other universes. Earth has always been a battleground, the ultimate gladiator coliseum in a warring universe.

# The Fifteen

After the first fall of Lemuria, they rebuilt their society, and there was a second rise of Lemuria, but this time they had to become more offensive. They had to defend themselves and Lemuria. This was tens of millions of years ago in linear time in this three-dimensional hologram. Lemuria had very little choice. To close some of the dramatic karmic timelines out there they had to militarize. The timelines of domination and control had begun on earth. There was karma to balance. The Lemurians went out and defeated peoples and places affected by earlier earth interference. They recaptured worlds under domination and control. At that point, there were as many as two-hundred thousand worlds under domination and control. It had spread that quick.

The fifteen multidimensional beings were here on earth. They were not part of the original creation here. They were founder beings who returned here. It's a touchy subject because it tips over a lot of sacred cows. Most spiritual paths and religions on the planet have been the creation of the fifteen, either one of them, a group of them, or all of them. It would be almost impossible for an average human to distinguish between one of them and a god. Why they came here, a new and developing galaxy, with the earth as its main planet, is unknown. The events leading up to their being here happened someplace else, another universe.

It raises huge questions about the creation here in the Milky Way Galaxy and our universe. It also commences our galactic narrative under a flawed creation model. The prime creator made mistakes here. It's an extremely hard thing for a culture of humans who believe in an infallible god to digest. The prime creator made a mistake or allowed ingredients into the recipe that changed the flavor of the creation. No matter how we look at it, the infallible god narrative has to go away. Where does that leave us? In the best position anybody could be in. It leaves us in a mature, responsible understanding of the prime creator. It is growing and learning alongside us. Everything in the life matrix on this planet has a relationship with the prime creator because everything animated by the prime creator is an extension of the prime creator. The prime creator is us and we are the prime creator.

One of the practices of the fifteen multidimensional beings was to trick other races, other peoples, into invading earth -- it's always been about the earth, our wondrous seventh-dimensional seed planet -- and two-hundred thousand worlds meant a lot of souls to spiritually invade earth. Spiritual invasion is done by hacking or controlling the incarnation grid. It takes place on the astral plane. The people are brought here in their astral form to the earth astral, which is the astral world associated with the earth. We need to go back to the divine hologram for a moment. Each world is a hologram, a sound and light fractal with its jurisdiction. If we take the physical three-dimension reality we are incarnated into, the one that has you holding this book in your hands right now, we are unable to go to other planets, other solar systems, or other galaxies, at least not physically, those of us not in the secret space programs anyways. It's the same on the astral. There are smugglers, people traffickers, and slavers on the astral -- as above so below. If it happens here it happens there. This is how deep the corruption in our system has been. Nobody has spoken these things aloud. None of the vaunted lineage paths in the east or the west have given this teaching. It has been prohibited until now. Those human beings who have known about what is going on here have been a part of it. If any of the spiritual teachings on this planet had told the truth they would have been wiped out, and many of them were in the past, the real past, not the glued together history we have now which is perhaps ten percent accurate and nothing more than an adjunct of the global narrative.

The fifteen wanted to water down, to dilute the soul force of the Lemurians. It had to be stopped at the source. That's what the spiritual invasion was about. It mirrors what is done on the borders of countries they want to culturally destroy. If a culture becomes a problem it gets destroyed, and one of the ways they do that is mass immigration. This is one of the reasons why Western Europe and North America are being inundated with the poorest of the poor. Think of the logistics of Africans walking to Europe, or Hondurans walking to the United States. How much food and water would be required to sustain fifty thousand people walking three thousand kilometers? The countries they are walking through are very poor as well. Where are the Mexicans getting the extra calories to feed all these people? Where do they sleep? Where do they go to the bathroom? Walking twelve hours a day it would take forty days to get from Honduras to Texas. If you walked twelve hours a day your feet would be destroyed in a week or less. Ask anyone who has been in the military about marching and how much instruction on foot care they're given.

Please do not confuse what is being said here with a lack of compassion. Everyone has the right to take whatever risk they need to take by the direction of their heart to make a better life for their children. This isn't about compassion. If it were, the US State Department would make the country a priority and improve the lives of people in that country. That would be the most expedient way to help the Honduran people, who have been the subject of corrupt government, US-backed coups, land theft from the peasants for transnational corporate farming, and a litany of other crimes and indignities. The migrations are a microcosmic version of what the fifteen did millions of years ago. Contemplate this level of warfare for a moment.

The Lemurians were multidimensional. They knew what was going on, and they set up defenses. Cities were built out of crystal upon earth chakra points. Three-hundred thousand powerful Lemurian seers would sit in these crystalline cities, remote view, remote experience, and remote attack another planet's sentience, or its species on the surface, killing everyone there. It was a grim business, and the Lemurians were not predisposed to war by natural creation and evolution on earth, but it was the only way to stop the incarnating soul invasion.

It gets even weirder. Some of the invading force was us, the lineage of the human race here now on earth. The migration patterns were both emigration and immigration -- some people leaving and some people coming. Lemuria's first rise and fall had a dramatic effect, massive migration away, then massive migration back. This cycle repeated.

All these wars are never-ending. Once something was destroyed there would be retaliation, the swing of the pendulum, the karmic tempo for this free will experiment we call our universe. It could take a thousand or a million years for someone to rebuild. There are now some two-thousand three-hundred races out there who have war karma with earth. The same fifteen beings from the beginning, from another universe, were the ones lighting the fire of anger in other worlds, so they would build faster, recover faster, and attack harder.

At this time, the time of Lemuria's second rise, there were three who were sixth dimensional, two who were seventh-dimensional, six who were eighth-dimensional, and the remaining four were ninth-dimensional. The ninth-dimensional ones came in with the third generation of immigrants from other universes. There were only three galaxies in our universe when these beings migrated here. We can call them the galactic mafia because they're separate of light and dark, even though they're both light and dark at the same time, but they're not neutral. Their goal was to become new galactic prime creators in this galaxy, which already had a prime creator. They wanted to use earth as their base. Its original mission to seed-free will life allowed them to go from galaxy to galaxy in an attempt to become the prime creator in the universe.

When this universe was created, the sentience created a contract with our multiverse to say _I'm going to be a universe_ to create consciousness, evolution, and expansion, and invite immigrants from other dimensions to experience _free will_. These fifteen beings wanted to limit the free will one galaxy at a time.

The fifteen got into this beautiful system of life on seventh-dimensional earth. They started their mission from within the earth incarnation system. As Lemuria built to its peak factions formed in it. We had spiritual factions, scientific factions, no-technology factions, high-technology factions, and many more. Society fractalized, much like we're seeing now throughout the West and other parts of the world. These factions began _the separation_ which took earth from a seventh-dimensional status to a sixth. The earth lost a whole quotient of its exponential energy. The separation caused a mass exodus. Earth was left undefended. She was captured. That was the first fall of Lemuria. The multidimensional beings who were here orchestrated that capture.

The new beings that came to take over earth reanimated Lemuria with the leftover refugee population. They began a domination and control system. It's important to understand that domination is multidimensional. We can appear to be living unshackled on the earth, but the shackles are astral and mental through programs, vibrational degradation, and lack of protection from the higher dimensional beings who were here before the demotion to sixth-dimensional status. The controllers began an incarnation pattern to bring in more of the kinds of beings they wanted from the other worlds normalized to domination and control.

At this point, the _good guys_ of the rest of the universe decided they had to do something. There was a huge debate among the ascended masters, the philosophers, and the wisdom and light councils participating. There's galactic sentience which created a war in another galaxy. That galactic sentience allowed it to come here. This is the first mistake of the prime creator of our galaxy. The galaxy we are in was not ready for war, was not set up for war. War came, nonetheless. Once the karma of war enters a species it's very difficult to get it out. Blood oaths and blood bonds carry throughout time and form the basis of future soul contracts. Anything can happen in a free-will universe, but even this twisted the rules to a proportion not conceived in the original design of the prime creator.

The fifteen beings had aspects of themselves in all the large families. If there's a family crest, it's been hijacked by spiritual contracts. This is guaranteed on earth. There were those here we didn't know about, outside the framework of the Royals and so on, ones who kept themselves secret, created mystery schools that have ten students every generation.

The light councils took forever to adjudicate. The conundrum was beyond the collective wisdom available at the time. In the meantime, many species took up war to defend themselves. It was natural. That created the first line of drama. War is so embedded in the human consciousness now it's difficult to refute Judge Holden, a central character in Cormac McCarthy's _Blood Meridian_ when he says, _All other trades are contained in that of war._

Mars is akin to earth in its fate with war. It had high technology and low spirituality in its beginning. It was a commerce center, but it turned commerce into a military-industrial complex. When Mars and earth began their first lines of drama, earth needed technology to support the defense and fortification process. That is how Mars and earth got interlinked before they got brought into this solar system. What is remarkable to note are the literal threads in mythology. Take this missive on Mars as the Roman God of War from the _Encyclopedia Britannica_:

> Mars, ancient Roman deity, in importance second only to Jupiter. Little is known of his original character, and that character (chiefly from the cult at Rome) is variously interpreted. It is clear that by historical times he had developed into a god of war; in Roman literature, he was the protector of Rome, a nation proud in war.

Earth went into this circumstance where timeline war became the norm. Around four-hundred and eighty to four-hundred and twenty thousand years ago all the two hundred primary _soul families_, the soul groupings of some two-thousand three-hundred different species, so there's only a slight difference in the soul families, but all of them were in competition to make earth _theirs_, and all of them had time travel technology, inter-dimensional vessels, and all of them had explored the universe. They were all in competition to make that _first species_. This is the basis of the time wars.

What the dark ones started so many ages ago echos through our reality today. The original design of this galaxy was continual evolution and graduation. This is the natural, organic process. The abuse of time technology for warfare corrupted the incarnation process. The cycle was broken. People could not graduate. They're stuck in reincarnating over and over with a brief respite on the astral plane before being sent right back. Atop this, there are whole migrations of souls not allowed to incarnate here, stuck in our astral world, unable to go back without a lifetime here. Our astral worlds are overflowing with all these things that are just stuck. This created all kinds of mayhem, nasty entities in a very impatient mood in the earth astral space, easily passable for what we describe as demons in some scriptures. The entire system was blocked, with no graduations and no new classes.

After Lemuria went through its first fall and rise -- some thirty million years ago -- there was a period of stability, but the fifteen multidimensional were still here, plotting and scheming to usurp the galactic prime creator. Earth's entire history has been war and domination since the first fall of Lemuria.

The Lemurians were moving through time with their air cities. They had to assay each time earth was teleported. The old timeline wars ended because the x-y axis of the planet no longer provided a time baseline. The sentience that was part of the old timeline was still on earth, and earth adopted the sentience as the new _first species_. Those new first species became part of the Lemurian society and left with the Lemurians. They migrated away and became part of the drama and tension polluted reality out there and were forced back to earth. Earth has been very similar to baby-boom parents who have millennial children who leave and return home to live, an endless coming and going.

Lemuria tried to push out as many of the negative incarnating souls as possible. They were coming from seven thousand worlds under domination and control. It's no different than a country having a rush of immigrants. It's one of the ways the negatives have tried to dominate the worlds. The Lemurians did a great job. Negatives did get into the earth's incarnational cycle, but not as many as hoped for by the negatives.

As a result of the time wars and all the other mischief here, there has been no graduation -- the movement of souls matured here to new experiential dimensions -- for many cycles. The normal cycle is a lot like our education system. We go through a course of learning here and move on. Our curriculum is measured in eras of light and incarnations. Everything is interlinked and connected. When graduation doesn't happen here, other beings in our universe are held back from moving to their next level. The situation got like a Los Angeles traffic jam on a Friday afternoon, but the Friday lasted several eras of light. This is what garnered the attention of governing forces.

The prime creator is like a mafia boss. He sets up the new rules. The system activates around the rule parameters. Numerous classes of co-creators build out on the rules. The prime creator waits for co-creators to go against the rules -- betray him. He doesn't need to know every move of the soldiers on the street. He's the boss. The co-creators are beings like us, _I am_ instances of various planets and systems in various densities. The higher density co-creators can see everything below. They have the advantage of greater perspective. There's a catch. The co-creators could not create if they didn't have the prime creator as an aspect of their being. This gets tricky. There are many ways to explain it metaphorically or allegorically, which is usually the way it is done in creation stories, but the time has arrived for a more literal definition. The prime creator can only be objectified by a subjective experience, a mystical experience. Why? Because the prime creator is everything, including the co-creators. Therefore, if you reason it through, the prime creator has to be good and bad to balance the ever-present corruption. Corruption can be corrupted. You have to be the antithesis of it, the opposite of corruption -- honest, transparent, sharing, good.

The prime creator's audit took place on March twenty to the twenty-second of 2013, the prime creator of this galaxy came in and audited this world's soul contracts from bottom to top -- anything that's ever lived here, anything that's ever been stuck here -- all of earth's soul contracts were read in a complete and total expression, so it came down to the final equation of where the earth was as it had traveled from the beginning of the setup of the management system we have now, the management system being _The Council of Twelve_ -- four light members, four dark, and four neutral. The neutral got kicked out by the dark ones. They said, _We'll kill ten billion of your people unless you leave_. The neutral contingent departed by compassion. The council reformed to seven light beings and five dark, meaning the dark could incarnate more of their lower-consciousness beings here, which would take earth's consciousness down even more because the grid's power was lower. The world had to put the dimmer switch on to adapt to them, by compassion, otherwise, those lower vibration beings could not be here. This is the definition of hijacking the incarnation grid.

There is no other way to describe this except metaphorically, but it's very real. The council of twelve tried to use CERN -- the large Hadron collider in France -- to _fudge_ the numbers. This is the true spiritual history of the earth. The prime creator audits the true economy here, which is the energetic exchanges and creations against the backdrop of the ruleset in the divine hologram -- a _for real_ audit -- and the ass jacks on the council thought they could fool the prime creator. We have to admire the temerity, and we have to note the prime creator's commitment to his ruleset. Free will is just that. Not even the prime creator can violate the ruleset once the game is in motion. The ruse was seen through by the prime creator, and they were all ejected from the game. All of those people that were part of the deception, the light, too, because the light was also doing some bad things at the time. There are light beings so immersed in the light they only see darkness. They're deep into polarity -- zealots -- and there's no neutral side between them. They battle just to battle because they've battled for so long they know nothing else. They started -- _I'll win at any cost._ When we say _win at any cost_ we're no longer light beings. We need to heal, go back to our source, and look at it from a different perspective. This includes the dark ones, too. The situation got so out of whack some dark ones turned out to be of the light, simply because it was the only way to counter the _light_.

Earth is a unique experiment -- a binary world with free will -- and the drama that has ensued here has amused even the prime creators, who have made mistakes. Yes, a prime creator for a galaxy is not infallible. Earth has proven that. The fifteen beings have proven that.

In our sixty-six planet solar system, Venus has always been the most philosophical society. The Venusians were affected by what was going on here, as were the other sixty-four planets in our solar system, but only the Venusians documented their concern. The Venusian philosophers got together in a massive psychic group-mind which was broadcast. The Venusians are known to declare seventy-two-hour peace periods. They are generally respected in the solar system. At this truce conference, there were philosophers from the light, dark, and neutral perspectives. They all sat down and debated. They don't argue. They just debate. Everybody's side is put on the table for trillions of people to watch. The Venusians are known for philosophy.

Earth's situation was very unique to the Venusian philosophers. If service-to-self ascension happens, the philosophers have no inkling of what it means. It is that new. The multidimensional beings planned and planned. They wanted to usurp a prime creator who is a spark of the universal creator. The universal creator might want service-to-self ascension out of the creation. The Venusians didn't know, but what a lively debate topic. If it was allowed it had to serve a purpose, and it was this which baffled the great Venusian philosophers.

A method of graduation -- in this case moved to a time-space where they could be productive -- was created for the fifteen. It's called service-to-self ascension, a cosmic left-hand path if you will. It's a concept created in this universe, a product of the free will experiment here. We created a whole new method of ascension. It has since spread to non-free-will universes. It was always a theory no one could prove correct. We did that, we human beings incarnating in this sound and light hologram. Let that sink in. We created something out of our experiences and trials here that we presented to God. It wasn't part of his original creation. This is an important thing to note. It's not all God giving to us. A creation like this multiverse is an opportunity for God to learn and grow. We co-work and co-create new things with our prime creator. It's a glorious and redeeming thing to know for us humans. We have a purpose beyond our understanding. We matter, every one of us.

When this was established, a way out for the fifteen, most of them came here fully. This means the parts of them elsewhere reunited with the parts of them here. These beings can be in more than one place at the same time. We all can, but they're fully conscious of it. Even with the offer of service to self ascension, not all of them moved on. Some of them dug in and continued their attempt to usurp the prime galactic creator here. They fully invested in the earth. These beings were so large they couldn't fit into a single human body. They incarnated into tens of thousands of bodies simultaneously. There are no other parts of them anywhere else. Others still have parts in other places. The ones that are fully invested here, the best guess from the light forces out there is they won't be able to succeed. Earth consciousness will absorb them because they're contracted to be here in some way, but, they've created side contracts that divert earth's main contracts. They're in charge of the incarnation grid. They've tried killing earth sentience and replacing it many times. They can't. Everything fails at some point. Service-to-self ascension for these beings could mean all of their pieces and parts individually ascend and become higher entities. If there's a part away from the planet, the guess is it ascends too. The possibility exists these new parts might become thousands of master avatars that can create more pieces to go to more galaxies.

In the end, there was a kind of compromise reached with the fifteen beings. Three of them were cast to universal nothingness, which is a kind of non-existence. One was asked to share the responsibility of the galaxy by the prime creator, and when the being did this it realized it was not ready and stepped down. Several of them were sent to other young galaxies as prime creators, so they could grow into the role of prime creator. Two remain. They are incarnated within about twenty-five thousand people each. What they will do is unknown. No more can be said about them here. It's best to let them be and finish their cycle here as well as they can.

# Rewrites

The earth has had its hard drive wiped and rewritten numerous times. This is a flagrant violation of universal law, but it happens nonetheless. This should tell you everything you need to know about the law. It can be contradicted at a fundamental level, all of it, gravity, aging, time. Nothing is guarding it. It's more of a suggestion than a law. Once broken we own the effect. You break it you buy it. Sometimes people break laws just to see what will happen. It's a learning experience. Did you ever eat dirt as a kid? There's a part of sentience that is forever eating dirt like a child, except the dirt becomes time, cloning, uncreational events, and everything else we can break. One person's evil is another person's experiment. It all depends on our level of awareness. Most people think an alien race taking over the earth is evil. It's an evil imagining -- despite the fact it's the undeclared truth of the earth -- but we have no problem with mass murder, genocide, and colonization among ourselves. Our worst fears are nothing more than having done to us what we have done to others. Even our imaginations are driven by karma.

The time wars began four hundred and eight thousand years ago, but once time war is introduced time itself becomes meaningless. What happens once time warfare is introduced? All time is changed. Even though the time wars only began four hundred and eight thousand years ago, they now infect the entire fifty million year history of the earth, because the inception of time warfare is the inception of no accurate time, going back to the beginning of Akashic Recording.

This is what is meant by a rewrite. The whole history gets rewritten, not just the history from the commencement of time warfare. Makes sense when we think about it. We are just rarely taxed with thinking about it. The collective unconscious, the _spiritus mundi_, as it was called in Latin, is aware of the time distortions. They are expressed in our popular culture, cinema, science fiction books, and, of course, aspects of this truth are retained by the conscious beings sharing the earth with humanity, unbeknownst to the vast majority of humans on the planet.

The fifteen multidimensional beings who incarnated here became forty percent of our breeding population. Fifteen beings equaled forty percent of humanity. That many human forms were required to fully incarnate one soul. That's how large the multidimensional beings became. At that point, there were almost seventy billion people on earth. This is how the fifteen got soul family status with everyone. They brought in dimensional technology meant only for vessels, installed it on earth, and began experimenting -- taking one continent out of a timeline, putting it back into a distant timeline, one by one -- to redefine the _first species_ of earth.

The first species is a spiritual title recognized by the prime creator, and enforceable in any court of spiritual equity. It has weight and meaning. It means that they who hold the title hold the deed. The first sentient species on a planet is a big deal. There are now seventy-two first species of earth. Every time earth was recaptured in these battles the _light force_ tried to rewrite the timelines. There was a problem, though. Once sentience is born it can't be erased. Earth has to adopt it as a first species. The time wars are all about creating the _first sentience_, and the light forces broke the law as much as the dark forces.

Earth is now a warehouse of species and timelines. Atop the seventy-two first species, we have six thousand different refugee species who've come to live in our world because their worlds are being decimated or destroyed. Earth has always been a soul migration spot. Earth is a migration spot because of its impressive graduation timeline. We have one hundred percent free will here. It's very important. There are other worlds where they remember all their past lives. They speak by the time they're four months old. We go through this growing process on earth. It's cherished in other worlds.

The blank Akashic Record is a unique ability of this planet, our precious earth. It's an aspect of the rewrite process, the shadow side of it to be more specific. It started in Lemuria, which was very high consciousness. Earth was its true seventh-dimensional status at that time. It created DNA and invited other species to come to live with her for a while. After some time, they could live above these womb chakras and create DNA, then take it to a new world. This was all done within the unity of the earth's original purpose. All DNA was moved by the law of free will and consent.

Each time free will and consent are violated a contract is signed -- you break it you buy it -- whether we realize it or not. It's true for us, and it's true for other species as well. It's the only way to learn.

Earth is also capable of physical teleportation. She can move the DNA wisdom created in her womb chakras to a blank Akashic Record planet on the cusp of inviting its first group of souls for coexistence. During the Lemurian times, there were air cities -- quite literally cities that floated in the air -- ground cities, and as many as five thousand species that came here to work with the earth, create DNA, and propagate that DNA. Earth is a nursery of sorts.

One of the things that has arisen in the consciousness of man is what has been termed the Mandela effect. It's named after the South African freedom fighter and eventual leader of the African National Congress (ANC). The Mandela effect was born as a phrase when a psychic named Fiona Broome said she had memories of South African President Nelson Mandela passing away in prison in the nineteen-eighties. In our actual recorded history, he died in 2013\. This would not have been very eventful had not many more people stepped forward to add their consensus, and this is how the _Mandela effect_ got coined. It's become so prolific in the cultural vernacular that the foot soldiers of the global narrative have been dispatched, in this instance academe, which has been one of the main enforcers of the global narrative -- collective false memories, confabulation, false memory syndrome. It's the job of anyone employed by the global narrative to demystify things because the last thing the controllers want is an outbreak of multidimensional humans.

The Mandela Effect is the karma of all those who have been manipulated throughout time, as well as bleed-through from other times. The system has shifted our reality and moved soul shards onto other realities so our memories would be fragmented. It is a way for the universe to put everything back to neutral and help us find the forgotten pieces of ourselves, the pieces and parts that have been manipulated and put outside of time. We have to get all the fractured pieces -- lost and found implicate orders -- together for the celestial medium of peace journey. There are versions of ourselves lost in void space who never got resolution. We can resolve that paradox by creating experiences and legacies.

The DNA farming that has gone on here on earth has left time scars. The DNA farmers -- Elohims, Reptilians, Orions, Annunaki, Arcturians, Sirians, to name some -- had different ways of perceiving the galactic commerce network through technology. They manipulated the flow of energy between star systems with technology, even though they had not achieved celestial medium status in their spiritual journeys. They were entangled observers using technology that simulated unentangled observer technology. This allowed them manipulation within thousands of years instead of millions of years. Those original DNA manipulating beings thought they were gods. They kept manipulating DNA and the flow of energy between celestial sources allowing them to farm all DNA on a grand scale.

The forgotten selves are part of our forgotten workforce. They are trying to get back into the zone where our precognitive workforce can perceive them. They are aspects no longer connected to the nonlinear soul. Their original linear time was erased. They are trying to get out of this erased time back into non-linear time. There is a network of forgotten selves that works together to be remembered. The Mandela effect is a broadcast to all forgotten selves in awareness, unawareness, time, and no-time. Wherever life has gone, even if it has been erased, there is an opportunity, a portal back to the hub of interconnectivity. It can be perceived as the trans-galactic exchange system between eras of light. Those forgotten selves will integrate with our precognitive and post cognitive workforce and no longer be forgotten but remembered and added to our Akashic Record.

These forgotten selves can represent themselves in an infinite number of ways. It all depends on how long they have been forgotten and what gifts they have to offer. Our other selves are the ones searching for the lost Mandela effects. It is our responsibility to indicate to our precognitive and post cognitive workforce that it should be a priority to find every aspect of our forgotten selves up to nine hundred degrees of separation from us in this phase of awakening.

This is the toll the time wars have had upon us. It's never been explained or expressed in our total consciousness expression, which is what we would call fiction and non-fiction. Many times things are allowed into expression through fiction. Sometimes it's because the build-up in the collective human unconscious demands it, so what is done by the global narrative editors is a release of energy, a meaningless catharsis. This is a form of energy harvesting to maintain the global narrative. If they didn't release the energy, like letting steam out of a pipe, it would explode.

Many aspects of consciousness are the result of time warfare and its consequences. When a human being loses a limb they can have sensations related to the missing limb for the rest of their lives. They can even feel the need to scratch the missing limb. Lost timelines and erased histories are like this. They never really go away. We can have a sensation that we have done something, know something, or remember something, but we can not prove it. Many times this can be timeline reclamation. Time is happening all at once. Our past and future lives are being lived right now.

All of these things, no matter how improbable they sound right now, will be openly understood and discussed shortly. It can not be put off anymore. The event has cleared the way for multidimensional consciousness.

# Yellow Box

Not many people know about the yellow box. The yellow box is technology to predict humanity's DNA expression over millennia of evolution. It is founder technology. It allowed them to go into the _potential of history_ and create small changes to allow co-creative evolution instead of forced evolution. The yellow box predicts the future. It shows the lines of the potential future. There are three yellow boxes in total. Two are controlled by the USA. One is in Las Vegas, one in Pine Gap, Australia. The last is in Germany. All three boxes give a line of potentials. All three must agree. The one in Germany no longer agrees with the other two. Two out of the potential three timelines have a much greater potential, but the yellow box in Germany is discordant with its other two. In seventy years of using the boxes, this has never happened.

As of 2015, they have not agreed. There are too many time travel scenarios, alternate timelines, temporal pollution. The people writing and editing the global narrative -- the cabal, the hollow earth races, external sources keeping this homeostasis we're stuck in -- have employed time travel manipulation too much. The boxes no longer work together. It's only a matter of time before one of the American-controlled yellow boxes shows an alternate timeline, and all three show unique timelines.

There is a fifth column in the battle to free the earth. They have done some positive time travel, creating a powerful and unpredictable _butterfly effect_. When the two American boxes that are agreeing now no longer agree, the box in Germany will not confirm the controllers' prediction model. When that happens, a very unique scenario occurs: the hollow earth races must exert control over the entire apparatus and infrastructure of control on the surface. Then the externals, positive and negative aliens, have to exert control to keep the hollow earth people underground and the mass apparatus of infrastructure and control here is going to ask: _Whose side do we choose?_

The boxes work on the law of the universe -- harmony, frequency, vibration, and the law of attraction and repulsion. If a timeline's potential is positive, its outcome is known, and humanity will naturally be attracted to it. If the boxes show seventy-five potential timelines, seventy-five percent of the people go with it. The other twenty-five percent go the opposite way because they aren't a match. They manipulate timelines and create micro-changes before, during, and after elections, no matter who is president in the United States. The frontman who runs the senate, the Vice President, is energetic as much as a physical seat of power. The Vice President is a ritualistic person who has energy constantly thrown at them, just like the President. The Vice President has a mechanical function in the unseen actions of the cabal.

History has been one-hundred percent rewritten. As multi-functional and multidimensional beings of awareness, we experience parallel timelines as linear. Our linear history is stitched together with pieces taken from all the different timelines. It's managed by the global narrative. The history books are rewritten every thirty to forty years.

Many times when they put us on a different timeline a lot of women have been pregnant fifty times with an off-world fetus, or a clone of themselves. They may not realize it. Egg and sperm can come together in an external source. The zygote is put inside the women for six to seven hours then taken out. Sometimes this is done two-hundred to three-hundred times to couples. It's done so the fetus has a signature frequency matching this linear time. This allows switching to other times. They use sperm and egg technology as part of the source-time frequency in breeding programs.

We are a farm. They farm us for our easily weaponized consciousness. Indoctrinated belief systems are used to put us onto alternate timelines. They never tell us we've been transferred. The indoctrinated believe what they're told. Timeline jumping is so remote in public discourse most people don't even have a framework to question such a thing. We have all these genetic programs from the off-world, good, bad, and indifferent, as well as the genetic hollow earth programs which keep us trapped on the farm.

Earth has many things like the yellow boxes. It's a galactic scavenger hunt for many of the off-world races. They come here looking for technology from the many wars and life forms that have lived here. It's scattered all over the planet, going right back to Lemuria. Since the misalignment between the boxes, we have an unpredictable future. This is an opportunity for the earth. It is an effect of the event, and it is the beginning of the prime creator's audit effect.

As dark as the world may look, we are on the cusp of indescribable change. Most of the control apparatus is gone or losing efficacy. It may seem like the opposite is happening, but that's only because the remaining control apparatus has to become more overt. The subtler forms of control, the fourth-dimensional control, the fifth-dimensional control, have waned. They're not showing it, but they're terrified. Many of the negatives left after the event, after the quarantine grid on earth was lifted. Those remaining are the zealots, the fanatics. They will have to have power taken from them.

# Light and Dark

There has been so much turmoil here it's nearly impossible to distinguish between light and dark. There are light beings in fake dark beings and dark beings in fake light beings, and then we have fake light beings who are both. It's been nearly impossible to escape the quagmire that is earth, the false god system, the sub-tracked incarnation process, and the outright hijacking of everything natural and true. What you think are spiritual masters are not, even if they might believe they are spiritual masters. The deception runs deep. This is the result of the free will experiment here, centered on the jewel of this universe -- earth.

Most of the religious leaders of the world are vile, misguided, or fully complicit actors in the great deception and repression. This may be difficult to hear, but truth like medicine is often bitter. The root of the deception has been the root of consciousness, our search for meaning and purpose. Religions are the mental corollary to genetic manipulations, just another way to keep us dumbed down.

An interesting case of a deep fake in the light and dark dance is John of God, the Brazilian healer. He had a very colorful public life. Hollywood stars like Oprah Winfrey endorsed him. He even had a difficult relationship with the Vatican, a very powerful social and political force in Brazil. They were instrumental in getting him arrested. He spent time in prison. In the end, he was arrested for child trafficking and other heinous crimes. He was running a baby farm and a eugenics program. He wanted to populate the world with his seed. Only about ten percent of his story came out in the news. The rest is too unsavory and shall remain absent from these pages as well. Whether John came in with a negative agenda or the Vatican broke him into using his ability to their service is irrelevant. He is a perfect example of a dark force masquerading as a light force.

If a true light force incarnates and leaves a legacy like a book, the moment he or she dies a cult forms and the same disinformation enthusiasts co-opt the movement and teachings. If it's happened once, it's happened a hundred times on this planet. There were other people here as _fake_ masters. This is easy for an accomplished magician, wizard, or an initiate of a mystery school on assignment. Consciousness is so low if someone even has a little astral ability they can pass themselves off as a _man of god._ The Ayurveda and Taoist systems are good but incomplete. There has been no way out of here for a long time. Anyone who claims otherwise is lost in one or another of the many inner deceptions. Contemplate this for a moment. We have been taught in most of the world's systems that life is nothing but suffering and these systems can lead us to a better and permanent place. So the gift of life bequeathed to us by the prime creator is worthless, to be lived with contempt, and only used as an opportunity to escape life by incarnation. It's uniform in both the east and west. Most of our instruction comes from our fetus in the womb plan, which is always about karma resolution, but the karmic system only operates correctly in a reality that has not been hijacked.

No actual masters are walking our planet. It's a rule. Many of them broke the rules in the past and were ejected from the game. The prime creator doesn't play any games or have any favorites. There is no nepotism with the prime creator because we're all equally related to the prime creator. It's also worth noting that no human can attain god consciousness. A human being can encompass an aspect of the creator, but no more. A lot of seekers see the nonsense in their birth culture, like the North Americans who run to an Indian ashram, but they put blinders on, stop using their critical thinking, and never see the bullshit on the ashram. It's just that bad. It would be great to have a better report, but the opportunity for spiritual growth has been this bleak for quite some time.

Many of the native cultures were quite advanced, and that's why they were murdered. That can be accepted as a general rule -- those with real knowledge were killed. This was an ancillary benefit of the European expansion, the annihilation of native cultures. They were autonomous. The plan of the global narrative was interdependence. Autonomy had to be destroyed.

Others have figured out the subtleties. They help us plan our contracts so we can get in here and be powerful. There are ascended masters who help us plan our lives a thousand lifetimes ahead of time, ten thousand lifetimes ahead. Many people are part of the resistance of free earth. Each person who has been planning hundreds of lifetimes is the resistance of free earth. Their purpose is to find the soul codes among all of our commonality of species and then complete them. Once we have a complete soul code as a species, domination and control lose their most important tool, which is the ability to keep us separate as soul families. But all of this is coming to an end now. The dance between light and dark is almost over.

We reached our peak of divisiveness early in the twenty-first century. A quarantine grid is enforced now. There are vessels in our atmosphere taking our consciousness and reinvesting it into the earth, slowly raising the energies of earth, like trickle-charging a battery. If they raised it too fast, some people on this planet couldn't exist here, and they would fade out. Our galactic assistants don't want that to happen. They want the graduating classes. It's all about enough consciousness here to accept the first two stages of the dreamtime events we have, which lead to the harder parts of consciousness to accept. Very soon the dreamtime awakening will happen. People will begin to have dreamtime together, and they will be conscious of it. This will wobble the narrative dominance of the pseudo-scientific paradigm we live in now. It will strike directly at the subject-object supremacy of thought and rhetoric in the public space. People will have unity experiences that begin to dissolve the false barriers.

They can't sell us into slavery anymore. That's what the quarantine is about. The quarantine has many levels. We have diseases here that aren't created by man. These diseases were purposely brought here. If a human being is taken off-world now, they could spread a pan-galactic virus that could kill trillions. It has happened in the past. Trillions were killed.

The original function of CERN was to _fudge the numbers_ of the prime creator's audit, but it had other functions, as well. It was a teleportation device. The negatives would try to teleport earth back to the densest part of its galactic journey. The people in that dense part would dream the rest of the solar system back to them. We are co-creating on the graduation timeline. All the other planets in the solar system are intricately linked to our graduating timeline. Co-creating spirits in that timeline can bring us all back.

Both sides, light and dark, broke the most fundamental rules here. The whole human race was taken on a roller coaster ride by zealots on the light and the dark sides. Rules are broken all the time here. You might even say the free will dream space was created to break rules, rules of harmony, rules of love, rules of equity, and those rules were broken so we could learn the balance, the lesson, but there are mistakes, and then there are _mistakes_. The level of chaos on earth has been epic, and with no clear spiritual value. Beings on the light and dark side have been ejected from this galactic ascension machine called earth, and they don't get to be a part of the graduating timeline, and this is both the light and dark beings. Both sides were doing nefarious things to alter the prime creator's will. They'd been experiencing the polarity of light and dark without the respite of neutrality for so long they lost their way.

At this point, the prime creator used what's known as the _walk-in rule_. Those who got ejected were replaced by new souls who took over all contracts and timeline functions. That was the first replacement of the management system. The second layer of replacement comes when the beings who are part of this contractual system of domination and control are going to be replaced with neutral beings with no political objectives, dogmas, or spiritual concepts. They simply see the information and the resolve is putting us as a species in a complete soul code. The galactic ascension machine has always been about taking the two-thousand three-hundred species warring over this planet and making them into a single species. When that happens we go back out to our races and bring the DNA wisdom they've been trying to hoard for themselves.

It might be hard to see right now, but it will become more and more manifest. The exposed darkness of the world is revolting to many now, child trafficking, transhumanism, mass murder, the alien disclosure, the litany of disclosures that started a couple of decades ago. It's the slow unfolding of the truth, bitter medicine indeed, but it has to be recognized. It has to be seen. Only then will people understand how badly we have been deceived.

The artificial intelligence movement on earth now is a replay of what took Atlantis and Lemuria down. There's a lot of repetition in the recent timeline. It's an aspect of futility, which everyone who has been trapped in this false god system is feeling. The dramas being played out now are like a song on the Akashic jukebox we have to play again because there's unresolved karma. Technology passed from one generation to the next created the failures of our societies on earth. Society isn't balanced between light, dark, and neutral. There's an overwhelming number of low vibration people in domination and control who use the technology to pursue personal power and ambition.

This will not last much longer, but the horror, the degradation of the human, the vain pursuit of the superman in defiance of our supernatural abilities will persist for a while longer. It will reach a point where people will become numb to it, but in becoming numb they will shut down their divine heart connection to life, and then, in the darkest hour, it will break like a fever, and a mad rush to spiritual equilibrium will happen. There's no other way. The negatives in charge of the world now have been abandoned by their multidimensional support and left to themselves they will reveal themselves as the frauds and counterfeits they are. It's a sour victory, and there will be no vengeance by human hands. They will simply be removed in disgust and the portion of the human race slated for graduation will move on as well. The earth will go back to its original function and purpose. Enough has been enough.

# Orion and Sirian Wars

The Orion and Sirian war was the last galactic war earth was involved with. It sounds strange to talk about a war that is not officially in our record, though it is being discussed quite a bit in disclosure and exopolitics circles, it happened, and it lasted a little more than half a million years, persisting in some ways right until today.

In 2006 we could have been done with this war. The Sirian, Gray, and Orion wars depleted the forces significantly. The light forces did not have the physical strength to come here and kick the negatives out, tear the power out of their cold dead hands, if you will, and, at the same time, they discovered a massive layer of corruption within their light societies.

They were using DNA smuggling from the earth trade to save other races. There are many races out there on the verge of death, infertile, incapable of breeding, the result of using cloning technology for eighty thousand years. They don't have sex organs or know how to have children. They do everything by test tube and expect the soul family to come in. So many of their soul family are stuck here. They're not inviting them, because their soul family rules are so specific.

These societies are desperate, down to a few thousand of their species remaining, so they used this underground smuggling network -- the fifteen multidimensional beings -- to kidnap humans off this world and harvest their DNA and the soul codes from them. All to save their species. They called it graduating.

There we see one of the great galactic moral paradoxes. Is what they did wrong, in the context of saving an entire species? Yes. It's wrong. Is it understandable? Yes, it is understandable when you reach the desperation of the last of the species. Yet, at the same time, they decided to go into cloning; they didn't listen to the better counsel in their species; they didn't slow down when they saw warning signs over generations; they didn't think of a backout plan from cloning; they made a free-will decision; they created the karma. Tough love? It's the love of the prime creator. All the direction is inside us -- all sentient species -- and it's our job as a race to stay on the spirit road to higher consciousness in harmony with universal law. They kidnapped humans.

When it was discovered how deep the corruption went, that light beings were in the human smuggling business, it was the beginning of the understanding of how insidious and how deep it went. Insidious. The Orion species are soul family to us. They were refugees here. We were refugees on their planet. They were both the good guys and the bad guys, and so were we. The wars are about soul societies and races pitted against one another, a galactic coliseum, each race throwing the other to the lions and cheering. It was eerie, the darkness within darkness, a galactic hanging garden -- the indecency of it, the totality of it, all to yield to the reality of it -- that which exists now exists forever. As much as we would like to gift ourselves the power of destruction, it is not being offered, but we may hurt ourselves in perpetuity. That is allowed.

Rebirth is the adjudication of many things, but in the end, it is the greatest mercy. Until the light comes on inside us, it's all maintenance down here. We will be perpetually maintaining what we destroy -- build it break it. It's a guaranteed economy, and as much as they say it's a free market, they don't take any chances.

The Orion wars came to a head in 2006\. The war was technology versus spirit. The spiritual side adopted some technology. The technology side refused all spirit. They were creating beings with no trees-of-life -- clone wars. It was an abomination, a violation so deep it was an affront to universal law.

They began kidnapping people from other worlds to become the perfect ship engines. People were taken for psychic energies they possess, taken from the corpus then implanted in a ship to be the drive energy. We produce extraordinary things on this planet. We are extraordinary beings. We're the last to believe it ourselves. The technologists violated sovereign free will. We were just a part with a number to them, an apathy so diabolical as to be anathema to spirit. When the wars came to a head some three-hundred and fifty planets counted themselves among it.

In one stunning move, the technologists released all their captured beings, their slave force throughout several thousand worlds. They just let them go like Castro emptied his jails and asylums when America was taking Cuban refugees. It was the tactical genius of a collective unbound by even codes of honor in combat, as only those completely devoid of empathy can be. A massive refugee nightmare ensued -- an unspeakable situation. In 2006 reptilian vessels were forcing themselves into the solar system. The forces of light were trying to finish the last of the Orion wars. This was the field of battle.

That is just one cycle of war, a recent one. There have been many. War has degraded everyone, but there always seemed to be one group taking it a step-down, less honor, less dignity, less respect for the prime creator and its laws, while still respecting our free will right to war. It wasn't so much that the wars were untenable within a free will, it was how much we grew into war, how multidimensional we made it, traversing even time itself in skips and jumps as a tactical map of warfare, Caesar's tent if it were the galaxy itself.

This is how deeply war got into us. It was all war all the time. It never stopped. Look around you. Almost any item you see had its origin in military research, including the knife you cut your food with.

# Annunaki

Nibiru or Planet X is real. It was a real situation with a real planet. It's been moved dozens of times. Technology was installed on it that keeps it out of phase. This is so our fear does not manifest it again. In the past, the main domination and control beings had pieces and parts of themselves throughout the timeline which could communicate to the central hive location.

Zecharia Sitchin's first three books are very accurate. His timelines are off. Sitchin's work was co-opted. when Sitchin wrote his books he had a multidimensional being helping him translate the texts. He was a highly spiritual person who had a purpose in coming to earth. He is accurate up to _The Wars of Gods and Men_. The timing is a little off because earth has changed time streams so many times.

The Annunaki were lured here some twenty-five million years ago, relative newcomers in context to the galactic history given in this book's history of the earth. Their planet, Nibiru, is a free-roaming galactic entity planet. It has a drive inside it that does not need a solar system to support it. They have a different version of a planetary drive. We have a unity consciousness drive. They have a dimensional drive. The consciousness only needs leadership to function psychically with the crystalline technology of the dimensional drive. They go anywhere they want, and do whatever is within their free will to do.

One of the dark ones, the fifteen multidimensional beings from the beginning, the bane of the Lemurians, lured them from where they were with carrots and sticks. As they were drawn in they saw leftover technology and destroyed worlds. They followed one to the next. Finally, they came to our solar system. Nobody was defending it. All of the light and dark forces had exhausted themselves and could not fight anymore. Earth was abandoned except for what was left of us. This was before the rise of Atlantis. Lemuria had fallen again through multiple timeline wars.

The Annunaki were baffled. There was all this technology scattered about and a bunch of primitive people -- us -- with high spiritual technology. The technology didn't match us, but the Annunaki couldn't piece together the forensics of earth. That's when they realized they were us and we were them. We were DNA-related. It dawned on them too late that they had been lured here.

The stargates of the sun are the passageway into our solar system, but an approaching race has to have spiritual relations, DNA relations to get into a solar system. The Annunaki were a free-roaming galactic planet that came into our solar system. They never knew they had DNA relations with us. The beings who lured them knew. It trapped them in the incarnation grid, stripped them of their most powerful psychics, and forced them into a reincarnation cycle. The next most powerful layer became the new DNA inputs for the skinsuit technology we had here. The Annunaki DNA and the soul codes were wanted. The Annunaki had traveled all over the universe with their planet. They were a rich harvest of soul codes.

The main control beings have been trying to collect soul codes. Soul codes determine our DNA and soul relations to a solar system. They determine where we can go. If we have only lived on ten planets, we can only go to those ten planets on a soul level. If we want to go to more, we have to incarnate into all of them. The dark ones were drawing people here who had soul codes from all over. The Annunaki had soul codes that opened up the universe.

Sitchin was correct about mining earth, but it was not about the materials. It was that the energy in the materials needed to go somewhere else. Earth-based souls who had migrated away would sense the energy of the gold somewhere else and be lured back into the machine. That's the control system here. The Annunaki still have free will. They did not understand the scale of the game they were brought into.

The Annunaki already had enough skinsuit technology that they were a little bit of everything. Not everything, but they had enough. They looked similar to humans, but several breeds of them chose different DNA patterns even though they were the same species. They could do anything they wanted to their DNA. The false light teachings essentially began by bringing the Annunaki here. False light beings and false light technology were created by the Annunaki and then spread to the rest of the planets of domination and control through the womb chakras of the earth.

Almost every religion and spiritual teaching on the planet has been affected by the false light technology and the false gods created by the Annunaki. It's a reincarnation system wherein the departed go through the false light and reincarnates. It is an absolute perversion and abuse of creational law. The lack of teaching on this planet and the imbalances created by violation of creational law have created a unique being, the human being, but our consciousness has been so redacted it's almost a negative net gain. Religion became the control system until the contemporary global narrative began to overtake it with the European enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, and our present man-machine option through our genetic tampering, nanotechnology, and transhumanism, all of which is the end run of a spiritually bankrupt people and social system.
