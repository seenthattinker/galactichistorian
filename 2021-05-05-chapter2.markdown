# Celestial Medium Journey

The celestial medium journey is the journey all who are capable must make now, and sooner rather than later. The moment has been prepared for us for the celestial medium journey. This is what the event did. It allowed for a graduating class, the first in a long time. The time wars and blockades and quarantines that have been upon earth have prevented graduation. When we don't produce ascended humans, another class of being, often in a guardian or mentor role with the human race, are prevented from moving into their new roles and dimensions, and on down a line like that. The human race and the planet earth have been the site of a huge traffic accident that has backed up the whole universe, the planes around us -- the earth astral zone that has an incarnation lineup waiting for life on earth -- the solar system, this Milky Way Galaxy and many others. It really can not be overstated how off the rails earth went. It's been a free-will train wreck.

The journey to celestial medium begins with self-mastery by daily practice, which becomes a monthly practice, a yearly practice, then a constant practice, a function as ingrained as breathing. A celestial medium expands consciousness to become a translator of the _blue road of spirit_, knowledge of the spirit and the ancestry working with us. This is the source of all healing and the place to plan the next evolution. It's us waking up to the temporality of time -- the birthplace of irony -- and deciding what more we have to do in time, or whether it's time to move onto space outside time, the creational space held by the prime creator. Again, it will come down to personal effort, at least in the beginning. Once you awaken and begin traveling in the other dimensions, it won't be work anymore. It will be joyous practice, a beautiful fusion of the higher and lower selves co-existing in one life experience. We might think of it as the return of mythology. Mythologies were consciousness maps, markers in time and space for a tribe, a people, a culture. Remember, this has nothing to do with the state of technology or what version of the smartphone is out. Technology is not the marker of advanced peoples. Some of the best-held cosmologies and mythologies were in tribal culture, the Hopi, the Mayan, the Dogon in Africa.

The point is that mythology was always regarded as real. In our twenty-first century, first-world dislocation and cultural psychopathy, we have lost that connection with the awakened imagination, that _blue road of spirit_, but don't worry, the event opened it up for traffic again. It will begin in dreams.

Mastering the finite _I am_ in acknowledgment of the infinite _I am_ creates the medium space by which consciousness skirts the sides of infinite and finite. The celestial medium takes up the million letter alphabet in this space -- the language the universe speaks -- and compresses it with their precognitive workforce, and uploads to the implicate _I am_. The explicate _I am_ -- the incarnation -- consciously downloads it to process and manifest. It then returns the data to the implicate _I am_ -- the being in the sea of consciousness within the ocean of awareness -- uploading back to the universe. The human mind and body can not hold the information forever. This is the back and forth method between the implicate and explicate _I am_ through the process of the celestial medium. There is a receive, respond, retain, release process in passing higher frequency information from the body's perspective. Bring it into the body. Unpack it. Decode it. This avails the data to your higher frequency level. The packed information goes up to the crown chakra and back to the source -- the frequency pattern of the universe around us.

We are incarnate life forms here now. We are not _up there_ in the celestial realms. Too many paths get this wrong, and in their zeal to understand the meaning and potential of human life, they forego being human. We don't have to do this anymore. Equally, the unbalanced life of the pure materialist, the titled, licensed ladder climbers who spend their whole lives gathering nuts, position, and status in the global narrative, are going to have to change, otherwise, they'll break themselves. It's a life out of balance as much as the cloistered eunuchs and barren women. We're going to find our footing somewhere in the middle. We're going to lead lives as spiritually rich as the devotees with the human part of our lives -- fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, community -- intact.

Spending too much time _up there_ distorts us if we hold on to it. Many channels end up corrupt because they don't let go of the information. They hoard it. The distortions lie unconscious in their bodies. It can lead to possession. There are external sources that want to possess bodies hoarding information. They dissolve the information into pure energy and feed on it. Letting go of that information is a one-hundred percent conscious effort. We must say, I am packing this information back up, knowing full well that I cannot hold on to it, and then release it back to the universe. It's a kind of insight catch and release program.

Our bodies adapt and evolve in this celestial medium process. We can't say we're both, an incarnate life form and a non _I am_ on the celestial medium side, which perceives time in a much longer length. Whatever agenda the micro-soul has, it's dwarfed compared to the celestial medium's length of time. The agendas don't match through the length of time, but they are both in equal experience simultaneously. You experience the super long game of the celestial mind, and the long game of the _I am_. It works with the higher spirit to be in the medium space. From the medium space, it transfers the _allness_ of the _I am_ into the code, downloads the code, returns to the _I am_ state, manifests with the code, then puts the code back into the celestial space. We simultaneously experience local time to super long galactic time, going back and forth, the finite and infinite _I am_ equally, and continuously changing frequency without competition for temporal dominance.

A self-spawned celestial medium is a planet's translator, able to speak to and communicate with other celestial minds, and it translates from the higher frequency to the lower density energy, allowing everyone to understand the common messages. The seventh-dimensional seed planet as a celestial medium is a bit different. Celestial mediums can exist on every planet, wherever there's a celestial mind. A lot of celestial mediums will spawn before a planet's demise, right before the light goes out. This has happened in other worlds. To save their life force, the celestial mediums travel into the future, to an endpoint of its consciousness, just before the light of the planet -- the literal stream of energy -- fades out completely. They locate the front point of their earliest celestial mind and absorb it, then they seed their celestial mind on another planet.

The life of celestial minds is inspiring, like everything else in creation. It's just one thing happening at different levels. Just as the white wisp of seedling leaves the dandelion with the slightest wind at just the right time, so too are the seeds of celestial minds blown from one field to another, one world to another in this scale. It's just life. No different than the turnings of nature here. Celestial minds have their astral worlds. They have their life reviews. They possess a variety of means to stave off death, natural processes by which something is spawned from their world.

When we have elevated ourselves, we transfer the consciousness of our _all_ to become the celestial medium of peace. It operates in the physical world, the red and blue road, and on the celestial road with its many brothers and sisters. We learn through astrology how different worlds affect us. We work with celestial minds which incarnate into our world and other worlds, both physical and non-physical, and as entangled and unentangled observers. We work with them at the celestial medium level.

Becoming a celestial medium of peace is our birthright. The journey is linear at first then it becomes fully non-linear. The linear process is self-mastery. We come to understand the length of our waveform, how strong and potent we are. This is so when we can go through the conscious choice to become the celestial medium between celestial minds and surface minds for the generation, we learn how to bring unique concepts of peace to places and spaces of time that are looking for that medium to inspire new layers of peace. As more people come into celestial mediumship, the global narrative will become more irrelevant. This is why consciousness suppression has been so important. Humanity will slowly realize the global narrative is irrelevant to the bigger streams of time. We will detoxify from Roman numeral time, and we could probably enter a system of commerce beyond the Babylonian money system. There are celestial exchange systems that allow the matter to matter manifestations from one density to another.

The celestial medium of peace role is not for everybody. It will be a percentage of the population. The celestial medium of peace souls had the contract to do this twenty or forty years ahead of time. It has been seeded in the three to five previous generations. The event was prepared. The celestial medium of peace group is a kind of celestial support system, creating concepts and language to navigate the changes. The celestial medium of peace will be there for anyone to connect with our planet.

The celestial medium of peace is a natural part of our multidimensional system. It has been suppressed and silenced, for the most part, the result of the embargo, the time wars, the quarantine, and a host of other things which have made life on this planet something of a living hell for most of us. It's important to understand that much of what has happened down here was not part of the original design. We were hacked on multiple levels, physically with genetic alterations, astrally with the incarnation grid lockdown, and causally with the timeline manipulations, which humanity gleefully joined in on with remnant founder technology like the yellow boxes. It has been non-stop survival here, incarnation to incarnation, with little time for human growth.

# DNA

DNA is part of the founder's technology. It is the connective tissue from the ocean of awareness and sea of consciousness to a light-based wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity. It was fundamental when this universe was being created, a unique experience compared to other universes. There are many variations of DNA. Non-biological DNA is solidified matter which can have DNA-based rungs and structures within its growth patterns, with its inherent intelligence. The crystal and mineral communities don't need to walk to have an experience. Walking is a unique experience. An entire line of creation springs from it.

The DNA strand organization, or the strands themselves, creates the weave of the DNA, the encoding of the strands. Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memory storage. They enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness. DNA can store frequencies of time. This is how we remember past lives, but not the only way. The organization of our strands and the rungs that connect them determine how much we can remember from past lives. Certain strands block out all past lives -- negative strands of wisdom and awareness. Many people within the awakening will replace negative with positive strands. On the other side of the awakening, new strands will be added to our capacity.

DNA is eighty percent memories. This is a fundamental understanding. Science and spirituality must realize this. We live in a photonic light reality with rules -- how we incarnate, express, exchange, and pass on. DNA is the encoding, the soul. The light body is the cipher that decodes and unpacks the experience. As we come back many times to the same type of living, we store memories in DNA lineages, bloodlines. The bloodline is how we imagine immortality in the infancy of self-awareness -- born again and again into a lineage with our stored memories. Our soul family incarnation process aligns us to the bigger concept of perpetuity. The search is always for the immortal soul, the final state of being.

We don't teach DNA lineage on the planet anymore. We are looking at DNA through the lens of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How can we hack it, spike it, tweak it? We're like the ape-men beside the black obelisk in Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_. DNA is light in another form, visible in one spectrum and invisible in another. Memory is not physical. It's a form of light stored in an experience. ​​​​​​​As streams of consciousness, we have thousands of sub-carrier codes of millions of experiences inside us. We only need to tune into the memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire.

Our forms are programmed to harmony -- the other twenty percent of our DNA is not necessarily entangled with consciousness. Seven percent is made up of harmony, frequency, and vibration. The remaining thirteen percent corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and non-linear time, what agencies we work or don't work with, and how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time-based you to create a brand new contract that is needed for change, auditing of the self.

To use our DNA instrument to the fullest capacity, to tap into our skills, we need to stop giving away our core energy. Instead of preserving and tapping into our source energy connection we keep using the background electromagnetic frequencies to stay motivated -- the white noise of our spiritual ghetto. There are so many voices now, echoing through our heads like a hundred tourists visiting an echo chamber in the Grand Canyon -- self-help nonsense with no understanding of the deeper strata of consciousness and existence; an endless parade of hawkers projecting their bellowing pitch in the thoroughfare, stocks, bonds, cryptos, minerals, security, prosperity, success, family narratives of fear and doubt inherited by unconscious epigenetic propagation; a million and one voices echoing through the consciousness of the twenty-first century man and woman. How do we ever hear the silence?

There comes a point where the living algorithm of life transcends into the ocean of consciousness. How do we get there anchored down by the consciousness minutia of our time, a time of vast technological advancement that has increased rather than decreased the burden of survival? Only humanity, alone among creatures on this planet, works against its own best interest or can be persuaded to do so quite easily. We're not an equation. We're not just binary numbers. We're so much more than that. The broken man, the man on the cross, has been the template for some time, and it's still working today. It's not who or what we are. The fetish of deconstruction has poisoned the world. We are a holistic creation, the human being, living in a holistic system we voluntarily left under the blindness of trauma. Science, cosmology, economics, and spirituality should have been unified generations ago.

Our environment does not activate us by itself. This is the free will choice of the sentient being. It has to be in our fate, our fetus planning, to even kindle the curiosity to look at the invisible webs of creation. Sooner or later we are taken within to complete the journey to knowledge. External sources can provide the initial catalyst -- a book, a retreat, encountering an awakened person, initiation into spiritual practice, or plant propelled journeys into the fourth and fifth dimensions, ayahuasca, peyote, mushrooms, or any other number of chemical to light stimulants in various shamanic cultures throughout the earth -- but none may be considered a path unto themselves, and they must be abandoned once they have proved out. Yes, there are other dimensions. Now choose a path, a discipline, a practice, and earn it.

# Modern DNA Manipulation

What has happened on this planet is almost unbelievable. In the context of the divine hologram, we need to see the good and the bad. We need to choose. These are standard conceptions of growth and maturity even in psychology. The shocking part is how deep the story of deception goes. When the negative species took over the farm they dumbed humanity down. This happened around seventy-five thousand years ago, long past the time wars, well into the time chaos we live within now.

The cerebellum in the medulla oblongata at the back of the brainstem is now part of the autonomic nervous system. It was not always so. It used to be called the tiny backup brain. There are reptilian species that have two and three brains because of their giant bodies. The cerebellum was implemented into skinsuits to impede evolution -- our journey to light and being -- and to prevent us from performing rituals and ceremonies which would have shed light on the fake masters and gods years ago.

Medicine was brought into this hologram at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to stunt our growth and support the global narrative's distortion and distraction. They don't want us to remember our true nature. In ancient times the hologram was very different. The global narrative was based on what the _gods_ told us. The cerebellum is the limiting factor for faith itself. The master DNA creators incorporated the cerebellum into the DNA by adding a rung, like creating a new organ, so we would not progress beyond certain experiences and awaken to the fact we're farmed. Our motor cortex used to be actively in alignment with our heart, brain, and gut. Now the cerebellum is completely integrated into our heart-brain-gut complex and interacts as a medium with our reality keeping us in a fight, flight, or freeze state. This is a catatonic state for consciousness expansion. The cerebellum can hinder us from having astral travel experiences. We can overwrite the cerebellum with heart-based meditation. This turns off the medulla oblongata. A superhighway between the brain and heart lights up. This is natural for human beings.

The sphenoid bone is the one with the great wings, just behind the eye sockets, below the frontal bone. It joins many of the other bones in the skull. When working on the sphenoid bone in Cranio Sacral Therapy (CST), we impact the other bones in the skull and the face. The sphenoid bone was radically manipulated so that our residual image would alter during our emotional journeys. When we are depressed our eye sockets are influenced through the sphenoid bones, the ears, the mandibles, the jaw position, how the sinuses are affected, and how much air comes in and out of the nose. The sphenoid bone was manipulated and integrated into the facial structure so we wear our emotions on our sleeves. It allows programs to take over sympathetic and parasympathetic control. Sphenoid alignment is one of the greatest emotional releases we can have. It interlinks with the parietal, temporal, and zygomatic in the cheekbones. In CST when we hold the occiput, and we feel for the movement of the sphenoid bone, people with imbalances there are usually suffering. It is the gyroscope of the face which is linked to a residual image. It's also linked to our capacity to be in the body and recognize our residual image.

Our inner ear bones determine how we hear the tones in our reality. Some people are tone-deaf. Our early infant journey determines how robust these bones grow as we are aligned to the space-time motion and our spiritual center of gravity. The size of these bones has been greatly reduced. They should be four times the size. This hinders our connection to sound and motion. One of the tiniest bones in the ear is the stirrup bone. If bones in the ears were bigger we'd be more spiritually centered. Programs would have less power over us.

The eyelashes keep dirt out and protect the eyes, but they're also antennas just like cat whiskers. We cannot always see them as we blink, but they're very much part of our visionary spiritual journey. Just like cats use their whiskers as a sensing system, we use our eyelashes to assist us psychically. Our tongue and eyelashes have been modified to allow the cerebellum to take control over motion action. If they were not directly hijacked, we'd be able to see all the other layers of reality.

Hair follicles are antennas too. Each different skinsuit has a different quality to hair. Our hair today when cut is dead. In the past, it stayed alive. Alpaca hair under the microscope is alive. The tubes allow light to continuously refract through them. Our hair should be the same way. In the military, they shave off men's hair to be able to control them better. The wind talkers, the native Americans, had thick long hair. It helped decode messages of the wind using light language. Eyelash hair allows us to input data from other realities. The hair as a system has been hijacked by the cerebellum. Hair is linked to our scalp. The scalp is related to the central location system of our file tree. Many people have a round bald patch on top of their heads. That says their DNA is limiting parts of their crown chakra.

The funny bone inside the elbow is a big nerve ganglion that has grown out of proportion to impact how the skeletal system interacts with the vagus nerve. It bypasses the skeletal system, so we feel more through the flesh than the bones. When our bones and hair are in sympathetic alignment, we get the feeling of our hair standing up at the back of our neck. They increased the funny bone size so it was more data-oriented than the other bones. By being more aware of the muscle than the bone, we gain strength faster and can lift heavy loads. This is how the manipulation through the cerebellum sourced and maintained the slave communities.

At one point, the DNA skinsuit could switch from male to female at will. Men's nipples remained because they couldn't remove them when they started modifying our bodies towards procreation, as opposed to recreation. In the past pleasure was another form of control. It's making something of a comeback in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

We're the technology of the founders. We're supposed to be self-entertaining, self-educating, and self-evolving, but this is in context to our environment, and this includes our inner environment, our thoughts, and beliefs. The global narrative is now, and has been for some time, the context within which our innate abilities grow and adapt. The problem is that the environment is false. True DNA does not know how to express the truth in a false context. The Adam's apple is another control system to limit men's sovereignty. It works through the projection of the voice during the _I am_ evolution at puberty. The loss and gain of innocence were controlled in the DNA through the lineages.

We have thirty-three vertebrates in the spine instead of forty. The side wings of the vertebrates should be a more robust expression. Our spinal column has fewer vertebrates and they're bigger. We should have smaller ones and seven more with greater space in between the vertebrates to allow more plasticity of the body itself. With fewer vertebrates, it's easier to become bogged down with depression programs. In some off-world DNA skinsuits, they have seventy-two vertebrates and a greater brain processing power. Each vertebrate is a part of the brain stem connected to the vagus nerve and cerebellum. If you take out the cerebellum, the entire skeletal spinal column is an extension of the brain. More vertebrates allow more interaction with the chakras beyond the crown. Giraffes have the bigger processing power, just like the Brontosaurus that had a ninety-foot long neck.

Our eyes and our third eye have been manipulated, too. The function of the third eye and our pineal gland is hijacked by the cerebellum at birth. Once you cut the umbilical cord, the cerebellum takes over the special awareness instead of having the third eye remain in charge of awareness until puberty. A baby with the third eye engaged at birth without cutting the cord would have a radically different perceptive capacity.

Our eye color is an aspect of the DNA and is directly connected to the residual image. A child can choose its eye color by changing it in the first few months. It's flowing through the Cranio Sacral system, projecting light out the eyes through the lens of their color.

The thymus gland has been manipulated also. It still goes back to the cerebellum implant. If you take the cerebellum out all of those manipulated and corrupted capacities would return to normal. At this stage of our development, the cerebellum cannot be surgically removed without rendering the patient brain dead. Due to the holographic reality we live in, some people have sixty percent of their brains gone because of an accident and they're still alive and aware.

The appendix was originally to help process vegetable matter that was very difficult to break down. The function of the appendix is not greatly understood now and it's often removed. It still helps to balance the gut gnome to dampen candida, amplify other microorganisms, and put nutrients into the gut system to support digestion.

The tonsils were a filtration system for airborne bacteria. They close off the air passageway to the lungs and act as a portal for fluid, like gills, for other atmospheric-type journeys. Depending on the skinsuit, it can change the sound of the voice when removed, where removal might impact on the potency of voice projection.

In certain DNA skinsuits, wisdom teeth have to come out for the jaw to function. Those are modifications to limit the body. They will rot if you don't extract them. Dentistry was typically a death sentence in the past. The name _wisdom_ tooth itself is a play and imprint on the belief system. The teeth are intricately linked to the nervous system, a vital part of what goes into our gut. Teeth help us to relate to our residual images. Some people can gain more of their reality through a set of fake teeth. Heavy metal fillings, like mercury, create a bio-electric frequency that distorts all of the nerve endings and the chemical reactions in the dental system. Teeth are often connected to entities. They hijack the gut through the teeth.

The shape of the organs is determined by the size of the vertebrates. More and smaller vertebrates would impact the organs. Everybody's skinsuit has different shapes of organs. This is the medical industry's deep, dark secret. Many people have _upside down organs_ -- literally. It's not a DNA flaw. It's just like consciousness in the DNA lineage is organized differently to allow a different experience. The organs are shaped differently depending on the skinsuit. The organ positions do not change our consciousness being in the vagus nerve or the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Many DNA skinsuits off the earth have a second heart in the intestinal tract which creates extended peristalsis. The cerebellum becomes another heart, controlling the micro-pressure of blood flowing through the brain, allowing brain, heart, gut coherence. The heart is the first organ, the tongue is second, the third is our lymph system, the thymus, the fourth, and the fifth are the gut and heart.

Our environment interacts with the DNA instruments through the pineal gland. Fluorides create a crystalline structure in the fluid sac of the pineal gland. The purpose of this crystalline structure is to take scalar wave information from etheric satellites to influence our local dreamtime in sacred geometry cities. Transformers on the light poles along the streets can create an omnidirectional field that interacts with the crystals in our pineal gland to keep us trapped outside global dreamtime. The plugs in our room, our TV sets, computers, routers, and many other deliberately designed devices create an electromagnetic field to suppress the pineal gland. Decalcification of the pineal gland is a good thing.

# Fertility and Spirituality

Fertility is another area of gross manipulation, as well. There's an eye in the heart. It's often activated through childbirth. Women can see through this eye in the same manner we see through the third eye in the forehead. The menstrual cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the third eye plus the ones in the heart, rectum, or clitoris, all extensions of the third eye. A man's third eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there. Menstrual cramps and pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas. A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts, ideas, constructs, and energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month-to-month basis. These powerful times for women are being hijacked and bastardized by the global narrative. The menstrual blood is very powerful as the energy of being a negotiator, an arbitrator, or peacemaker.

Menstruation continues after menopause. Women still go through the cycle without blood. The fertility spirits attached to menopause move on to a higher density. The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding, but the spiritual mechanics remain the same, even more intensified through menopause. In most cases, when women experience heavy menopausal symptoms, they're giving birth in other simultaneous realities which need the births. Their remaining fertile life alters versions of themselves who did not get pregnant. Using their biological clock, they find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.

Hot flashes can happen when an alternate version of the woman is breaking water and is more than likely going to die from birth. They transfer chemical life force based on their experience to avoid this. A hot flash can also be another version of us in another place and time, and in an alien form, in which the birth got difficult. Birthing is part of the karmic resolution. This is important to remember. Through strands of awareness in the DNA, the connective tissues transfer life force to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of ourselves who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all. This allows the mystical births to happen, the babies who should never have survived or lived. Evening primrose oil is one of the natural remedies for hot flashes. This plant oil is harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and, at the same time, it amplifies the experience on the unseen side.

Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility. It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body. Other strands had more opportunities to awaken. When a woman who never gave birth is going through a very difficult time during menopause, another version of her simultaneous existence is going through a birthing experience. They are both intrinsically linked to reducing the negative effect. There are times when co-living souls go through menopause together. This generates new life in celestial nurseries. It gives birth to a new soul frequency in the ocean of awareness. The new soul frequency begins the journey into the sea of consciousness and manifests in time and space.

The fatty deposit around the midline during menopause serves as a protective membrane, but it can block good experiences with regards to working with a woman's residual image. Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking, the _awareness clock_ takes over. We can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening. We can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry. It's a balance between overproducing and underproducing hormones and chemicals.

Men go through menopause too, and they also have their process through cycles of creation. As they actualize their physical manifestations, a house, artwork, business, what have you, they leave their legacy for their clan, tribe, nation, or zeitgeist. Men build an archive of experience that stays manifested in time and space. Lineages in the unseen can plan lives through the infrastructure created by the urge of manifestation.

Men reach their sexual peak around the age of eighteen, women in their thirties. This is why the infrastructure in the unseen needs to be planned. The cycles have been manipulated by DNA farming. If the human reproductive cycle was not manipulated, most pregnancies would be eighteen to twenty-four months. In some instances, it can be up to five years. In the past, the umbilical cord wouldn't be cut for months. This allowed more bonding between the partners. There was more opportunity for the father to have a ritual connection to the child through the mother as the medium of the connection.

Testosterone drives creativity in men. There are other things similar to testosterone that drive construction. A male scientist does not use testosterone, but he uses another version of it, a mental aspect of testosterone. There's no scientific name for it yet in this reality. There are several hundred forms of testosterone, each with a different chemical chain that allows a different aspect of creation. Through manipulation of our bodies, we are not producing the all-encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight, flight, or freeze. Our glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.

The birth control pill is manufactured from giant farms of female horses. The urine of a pregnant horse is the chemical basis of the birth control pill. The horses are pregnant their entire life. Their colts are taken and chopped up into horse meat and sold to pet food manufacturers and fast-food restaurants. The entire industry revolves around the urine of pregnant horses for human birth control pills.

Many women reject the different types of pills. There's a malaise associated with the pill they can feel. They become worse and worse until they get the birth control pill out of their lives. Before the horse urine birth control pill, there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy. Like most lineage medicine -- Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy -- it was delegitimized and marginalized by the big allopathic medical footprint that coincided with the big push into the twentieth-century economy, in which everything was patented, synthetically replicated, restricted to _licensed_ practitioners, taxed and brought into the mercantile system. This was an ancillary component of the imprinted global narrative at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

# The I Am Individuation Process

Every moment within a time-space equation creates an energetic imprint that cannot be erased. We're always painting on the canvas with the sound and light in our heads. Even thoughts are recorded, states of mind, emotions, not just actions. We're always creating. Self-mastery is creating in full consciousness. Sovereignty is full responsibility for every thought, word, and deed. There are no splitting hairs on this point. The new age movement proselytizes intentional co-creation in faux ritual, basically wish-fulfillment. Everybody buys into it, this dumbed-down version of the co-creation absent self-mastery. It's a recipe for disaster, a moron's guide to magical malpractice beginning with the state of mind.

No two physical objects occupy space simultaneously. There is no simultaneous or identical history as they follow a unique light path. We are a standing sine wave of existence as the _I am_ apex in the incarnated now, in resonance or dissonance with our previous and future source streams. The quantum hologram carries the complete history of each energetic imprint of all source streams within this timeline paradox.

We have mighty _I am_ selves in the past where we were extremely powerful energy being compared to what we are now. As part of the karmic resolution, we gave away our _I am_ self-sovereignty to conduct timeline recovery operations. Those ancient _I ams_, plus another forty to fifty _I am_ selves spread all over timelines and dimensions, are still making decisions that can alter our present choices. This is one reason why so many people are unsuccessful in this present world. When we have two or more present selves making choices in a free-will universe, one choice contradicts the other. We cancel ourselves out at the co-creator level.

There is another level of paradox in which we have one present self on high energy earth and another present self on very low energy earth. One can easily dominate from high or low energy. Reclaiming our sovereignty reclaims our authority from all high-energy versions of ourselves in competition and hierarchy. It removes our citizenship from all involved organizations. All our shards, parts, and avatars can leapfrog forward in time and claim unity consciousness to remedy all paradoxes.

When we transit timelines, we must figure out which is optimal for us. It can also be involuntary. We could call this a form of harvesting. We can get deliberately thrown off our timeline, or we can have chunks taken out of us and put into different timelines. This sounds fanciful, but remember, our DNA is technology. Entire ancestral lineages have been harvested like this for eons of time.

A point comes when the harvesting ends. We must make a final choice to be here and now with our friends and family. A scenario like this would be planned before birth. It is often facilitated through a traumatic experience in this lifetime. It gets us to the timeline we need to be on. A good way of working through such traumas and dramas is to look at a photo album. Get in touch with us at the various stages of our lives. Bring memories to the surface and look for pattern recognition. People are often born onto the wrong timeline. The soul knows it. It has to go through trials and tribulations to get back to where it needs to be. The dreaming body -- the main time-traveling technology for us -- facilitates those changes.

The mighty _I am_ apex presence co-creating self has come into this world now as a representation of all our sentient selves which incarnated into this world before with decision making power for all the celestial minds of our past, present, and future lives. Only the ever-present mighty _I am_ self in the now can make choices in co-creation with the unity consciousness world. In other words, the _I am_ apex presence of the now is the ultimate choice mechanism of this lifetime. Other aspects of our self can provide the information upon which we make choices. The ever-presence is all of our other selves in dominion with the _I am_ presence now resolving contracts with soul family, soul planets, or whatever else we are experiencing in this reality. We, as the _I am_ apex presence, are deeply honored by all the ancestors because we are in an ongoing co-creation with the world to expand consciousness as a global community of transformers and consciousness explorers.

The essence of this universe is free will of the _I am_ presence now. The soul and higher self are included, but the higher self does not get to make choices, only the _I am_ presence does here and now. The higher self can counsel but it can't give us the questions, only the answers. When our history is eliminated, it puts us in the paradox of paradoxes. We don't understand who we truly are. We may not even have any questions to ask. This is often an indication that there are parts of ourselves making decisions for us without us involved. Those paradoxes can be forty or fifty _I ams_ at the time working on destruction rather than evolution. We can't destroy other _I ams_, but we can work with them. We can heal them, or we can ban them through our free will choices and actions within the authority as this _I am_ apex presence of the now.

We are already the higher self. The _I am_ is here in time, as constructed by the higher self during womb planning, and the higher self is holographically interacting with you at all times. The _I am_ here and now is based on several previous _I am_ selves who have gone through life reviews and set up a theme of karma or dharma for this lifetime. In the first five years or so we fully activate our _I am_ technology. The rest of the _I am_ comes in during puberty. Our higher self remains the sacred neutral observer throughout all our incarnations. When we die, we meet our higher self again as ten thousand past and future generations of other selves. The _I am_ is the technology of interface with the God source already in us. We have to learn to get to know ourselves as the embodied spiritual human to understand our soul's purpose and missions.

# Precognitive Workforce

The _I am_ precognitive workforce is all versions of ourselves at the same time. Nobody ever speaks about future lives. Why not? Why are all the religions end-of-the-line trains? Why do none of them discuss the continuity of life? Why is every path on this planet a thinly veiled prison break? Why are they all so contemptuous of the earth? Do we even realize how long we have been breeding contempt for life? What a happy place to begin a lifetime -- this place sucks, but the next place will be better. There is no next place not born out of the trials of this place. They are two versions of the same thing at different frequencies, one so dense and domineering it blunts the other. Mythology is the bridge between here and there. It was always literal. That's why this new mythology of the galactic historian is as literal as possible. The age of metaphor and allegory is over. All the ciphers are deciphered already. That's another part of what the event did. We're so used to not knocking on the doors of the next world we don't even remember if anything might open the door. Now is the time to knock again.

When the global narrative ramped up with the Industrial Revolution, the separation between the subject and the object increased. Mythology fused it all like a poetic container, but mythology was rendered impotent by the Industrial Revolution. It just happened so fast, from the outhouse to nuclear power in the blink of an eye, with only two world wars to clear the path. That's quite amazing. Change and violence are symbionts in time. They coexist in the same times, places, and circumstances -- always. The faster the change, the greater the violence. The global narrative has been written in blood. They never needed ink, but they sure like it.

The global narrative made us forget about the other side, our doors to it, and our birthright to at least know it, if for no other reason than to transcend the fear of death, and that's what the old mythologies did -- they conquered death. Nobody is saying that's the end of it. It goes on almost infinitely, but overcoming death is the first step toward a new construct with new riddles. Death is the main riddle of this third dimension. In some eras of humanity, we lived in full knowledge of the life and death process, the golden age and the silver age had no death. The body ended but they knew it was not the end of them -- knew, not believed -- and that was the difference. The dark ages of man, and we are coming out of a very dark age now, some of us will anyway, not everyone -- very important to remember that -- are periods of low consciousness for man. That's what all the violence has been about. It stuns consciousness and puts it under a blanket of trauma. Trauma is undigested consciousness. We can not see clearly until we have digested it. The underlying truth of religion has been -- _get out of here_. It's fundamentally right, but we're not going anywhere. We have to get out of the false world we were conscripted into co-creating, the beliefs, lies, and superstitions that have proliferated under the global narrative, the rank filth of these programmed limitations. We were created to know things, not believe them.

The final solution for consciousness as written by the global narrative is depression, self-loathing, and self-immolation. Bad human. Into your crate. Your behavior has destroyed the earth. Rampant use of fossil fuels, which you had no choice but to use because it was the underpinning of the global narrative's economy, has brought us to the brink of extinction, which just happens to coincide with end times in all major religions in one half of the world, a kind of secular apocalypse if you will, but potent in striking fear into the heart. That's the whole point, to throw off the compass of the heart because the heart is the only instrument that can navigate us out of the global narrative and back to celestial mediumship. That's why there's been so much violence, so much change, and so much fear in the heart. When the collective heart is full of fear the world inverts. Rather than create the universal template of beauty, we create ugliness. We murder more babies than we birth. We become denser by our systems of education rather than lighter. Everything inverts. It's part of the binary system in which we live. They know it. They can flip it like a fuse box.

Our precognitive workforce has been limited by a global narrative that corrodes our ability to believe in ourselves. It's such a ridiculous thing on its face -- belief in yourself -- but it's true. We are so far removed from any semblance of being human we have been reduced to _believing in ourselves_, you know, like a salmon needs to believe in itself to swim back to its spawning ground, or a hawk needs to believe it can nosedive to a kill from a thousand meters. It's humiliating to have to believe in ourselves, but here we are, reduced and depleted by DNA manipulation -- slave engineering -- untold generations of dreamtime blockade, witch burnings, violence, torture, warfare, and trauma. It's no wonder it might be difficult to believe in a precognitive workforce. We stopped believing in ourselves, looking in ourselves, which was the desired effect of the global narrative. There's nothing to believe in. We are far more than we've been taught.

The spiritual is at the far end of the acknowledgment spectrum. Evidence is a compelling case, but, like everything else, it falls prey to the context and details alignment. Yes, gravity is real, but only because it's the consensus. There's never been a generation of human beings that did not produce human beings who could levitate, so yes gravity is real, but only in context to the natural human experience. In the context of the supernatural, gravity is not real. It's just a low law of nature that can be opted out of when we develop. This is not to say that people should drop what they're doing and pursue a life dedicated to the nearly meaningless accomplishment of levitating but do be honest when assessing the law. Gravity is a jurisdictional law. We can go places it has no jurisdiction.

We're more likely to accept a chemical definition, because chemistry is scientific, and science is the soil in which they want to culture scientism, a new religion in which object truth will be the only accepted norm. In the case of dementia, old age for example, where the earliest memories become the most lucid and immediate, and short-term memory becomes more difficult, there's a breakdown of chemical memory association in the file tree. This is where the skull cap -- the top of the crown -- tells the spirit where all the files are stored inside the body. The chemical memories are corrupting the file tree because the brain itself has broken down through lesions. Cellular pathways don't have the energy to support the brain. There is a breakdown in the genetic journey and part of the life and death contract. In a limited context, chemistry explains dementia, but it doesn't give a full definition, nor does it pretend to know anything about death. There is no science of light. Electromagnetism has shut down for public consumption a long time ago. It would have unified science and spirituality, and it would have proved gravity was a jurisdictional law. That could not be allowed to happen.

Significant distorted memory just before death triggers a markedly different form of life review. Reverting to younger versions of the self is a co-existence in time through bilocation. It skews the light memories. The light body does not identify to a single point of time anymore. This is the corruption of the chemical memory, the time stamping. This disease can be contracted by the fetus in the womb or by DNA design and plan.

There are certain DNA skinsuits with a prevalent experience in them. The fetus knows that before it goes into the DNA form for the experience. There is much we can do to prevent this, but we don't have the proper gut gnome from a very young age to support brain health. The life journey was cut radically short by the manipulation that was done to the DNA about 35,000 years ago when the brain stem was augmented. The motor cortex functions were assigned an earlier ending date than the actual extended life process. This is what has been done to us, difficult to hear but necessary. Many of us could live two to three hundred years if we had proper trauma resolution so as not to burn out the neurological pathways. Optimal gut health is a remedy to avoid plaque build-up which causes dementia. It is all about the volume of individuals who are part of the ocean of awareness choosing to experience law as a fundamental value of experience from one era of light to the next.

Universal laws come down to egg and sperm technology, or other birthing processes that generate lineages differently. The birthing technologies determine how the universal laws are used, and every birthing technology has different quantum laws. The sperm, seed, and egg technology allow access to the infinite blueprint at the planning stage. Sexuality and prayer are built into our DNA. Our DNA is in sympathetic creation with the natural order here. This reality gives us coherent resonance with geometric holograms of information to decode, process, and use to our advantage.

The journey into greater awareness is understanding how to use our energy as a conscious being of choice. We start in this bliss state where the infinite code is in the celestial mediumship. The celestial medium steps down into the fetus and goes through the laws of forgetting so it does not have access to its infinite sight. It then is a part of this hologram as a non-infinite being who is on the journey to celestial mediumship again. We are forever trying to get back to that place of bliss and joy. All the teachings since the dawn of spirituality have blissful teaching. It is our birthright. Inside the fetus in the womb state is the non-locality teaching. We are both locality and non-locality. What makes us different from the fetus are the memories we have stored in light. Our blueprint as a fetus has the infinite set of memories and potentials we've created. The incarnation process allows us to experience all forms of life on the planet. We go through all the forms of life. This is the mastery path in its purest form. The _I am_ data unpacks and decodes itself through its eras of incarnation. We add the chemical memories to enforce linear time so spiritual contracts can come to fruition.

Our precognitive workforce is the light world to chemical world bridge. It's another opportunity for science to study spirit, but it's difficult to get a community committed to objective truth to even accept spirit as a noun, after all, it's not a person, place, or thing, but none of them would exist without it. Science is trying to mimic what our mythologies did for us, conquer death, and certainly, the _black_ sciences practiced in America and elsewhere, the _Paperclip_ science, has traded off-world for anti-aging and regression technology, but without the proper the spiritual context for a longer life, which would be greater surrender and service to the larger purpose of earth, humanity, and our multidimensional reality, new forms of monstrosity can only come about. Use your precognitive workforce. It's there for you.

# Precognitive Sharing

Our precognitive workforce is us. It is the understanding we can create infinite conscious versions of ourselves and travel time, future and past, and prepare a resource of knowledge and information we can instantly call upon as manifestations of inspiration to beat anything negative. Our _I am_ precognitive workforce has earned the right for cross-time collaboration. There are negative frequencies in this journey. We need to empower ourselves. The _I am_ in the here and now declares itself a being of co-creation, absent competition and hierarchy, a dreaming _I am_ breakaway DNA light body civilization of one in this life form, the human being. We can use the genuine work to make a great impact on loved ones, family, clan, nation, tribe, and earth mother. If we choose to do this on all scales, we need a masterful precognitive workforce, our birthright, and legacy, to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is part of the great dreamtime awakening. We use our responsibility to impact the loves of our lives, the themes and ideologies we promote to others, a little dreamtime capital so they can find their illumination, free from gurus, without sending them down paths to false illumination. Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us, to think with us, to love with us, to be part of our greater expression. We must put the time, effort, and energy into understanding we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions, time streams, galaxies, and universes to form a forceful collective, all of us, all part of this dreamtime awakening, freeing ourselves from the limitation of the global narrative.

Shamans have always used their precognitive workforce. Every generation learns from the previous. We are a signature frequency match to our precognitive workforce, and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of our light soul teachers, all of the _I am_ instances as part of our great hall of Akashic Records.

We tread on someone else's journey if we send out our precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way. There's a fine line where too much is too much. If the other being has no precognition, or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is, we are stepping on their journey. Infants or young children who haven't formed an _I am_ yet are okay. Most children don't fully form the _I am_ until puberty when the thymus gland creates three hundred new chemicals that suddenly flood the body. This is puberty itself. It solidifies the _I am_ technology as a time-space equation. When we assist others with our precognitive workforce, we have an interdimensional conversation with them whereby we join our precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities. It helps each of the parties co-create an event that brings inspiration and healing. Healers become facilitators. They amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the precognitive workforce of the ill person. The ill person may not have any consciousness skills. If those _I am_ beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination. There's an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening. Discover what's the signature frequency match for you then go out, evolve, and create.

Our temporal awareness has been manipulated. A lot of weaponized time travel technology interferes with humanity's capacity to perceive time. We can be heavily confused with our temporal awareness. Confusion is an aspect of temporal distortion. It can be sped up or slowed down. Our temporal awareness is unconscious to time speeding up or slowing down. Our temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move. Separate from the vagus nerve, the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain, heart, and gut, then all three separate from unity, making it easier to split consciousness. The connective systems between the thymus, brain, heart, and gut are where we can hijack temporal awareness. That is another limiting system that was put inside us, however, it has backfired on the temporal manipulators. It gives us other _backdoor frequencies_ of awareness through the temporal body.

Temporal hijacking has been around since the dawn of time. The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to the time stamp. Interlopers discovered the infinite journey of the soul then tried to figure out where, when, and how they might create an incoherent pattern and get a soul trapped in an era of history. They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for DNA farming and hinder the _I am_ consciousness from again entering the sea of consciousness.

Temporal manipulation started forty-eight to fifty-five thousand years ago. Not all life forms practiced temporal manipulation. It was about limiting the number of life forms on the surface of the earth. Particular DNA lineages were not receptive to this temporal manipulation. We went from nine-hundred thousand different forms to one-hundred and thirty-five thousand. This is the basis of DNA farming. This is how they manipulate and limit who is going to be on the farm.

The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the simultaneous existing network of selves. This forms the hub of interconnectivity, part of our precognitive and post cognitive workforce. The unvanquished dream is an aspect of the infinite interconnectivity, giving us an even greater connection to all the versions of ourselves sharing that perspective. The unvanquished dreamer of peace comes in here too. It connects to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness, the many seas of consciousness, layered atop all forms of thought and awareness, to connect them in a single time-space location. It's a state of being that can walk on time.

# Mind Heart Gut

It's important to create distinctions, to set things apart, to be specific about things. We've discussed a lot so far. It's all a bit detailed. A little context is required. Our precognitive workforce is in the ocean of awareness, but we have a lot more equipment. A lot of our hardware, our skinsuit, is unknown to us. It's kind of remarkable when you think about it. Deconstruction is our main pastime in the _the enlightenment_. We have modern anatomy because da Vinci dug up bodies and dissected them. Philosophy may not have murdered the wholeness of God, but it certainly helped bury the body, not that it matters; it was a false god anyway. It only marks the last time we lived within mythology, contrived and spiritually dead mythology, but it nailed heaven and earth together well enough for peasants. We're on to nanotechnology, RNA vaccines, CERN cracking into other dimensions with the Large Hadron Collider, but we know the barest of details about ourselves. When we remember the global narrative it all makes sense. When we remember the relentless and brutal suppression of human consciousness, it all makes sense. You can not control an autonomous thing. You can not persuade a spiritually aware being to volunteer for codependency. You can not manufacture consent.

Three parts of a human being pass information -- the mind, the heart, and the gut. We say when asked how we know something, _gut._ Everybody knows what we mean -- not empirical -- a kind of instinct and intuition. The heart is much more verbose in the human record. We attribute the heart to conscience, moral direction, love of the creation and the creator. The heart is a powerful receiver in the human system, and its proper functioning opens up higher communication from the light worlds. It is in many ways a passage between the chemical and light experiences. Many forms of addiction are the result of not wanting to deal with the heart, distilling some feeling of betrayal, or allowing the trauma to dominate the heart.

The mind is information processing and a very powerful receiver itself. It is the easiest part of a human being to trick, control, program, or destroy. The human mind is a fractal of the universal mind, which is all knowledge, as the heart is a fractal of the universal heart, which is unconditional love, and the gut is individual to us except for a network of conscious beings. When the three parts work together, a nearly perfect human information system is operating. Why don't we know that? Why don't we incorporate it into our basic education systems? Well, who would profit from that enterprise? It's amazing how many questions you can answer with that one filter that defines the system logic we live within -- who would profit from the enterprise?

Sometimes the mind processes better than the heart, or the gut, or the other way round. Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind, the heart, and the gut have to work together. Once the mind-heart-gut starts working together, the analogical side of the mind -- which compares two things -- gets stronger, along with the empowered programs that are with it. This is why daily practice is so important. We use the brain to interpret inter-dimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self. The brain is the instrument of experience. It has a gut-brain and a heart-brain, each with its sense of time.

DNA communicates within the skinsuit. It communicates from form to form through incarnations. It communicates between incarnations. It communicates to our light bodies. It goes from chemical to light. This understanding allows reasoned contemplation on many consequence theologies, the wages of sin, the sins of the father, and karma itself, whether applied to an individual, a family, a community, geography, or any other distribution point; it's all one DNA communication network, the prime creator's backbone for several layers of experience, straddling light and chemical, which correlates to the physical body and the light body. We are simultaneously living _I am_ versions of ourselves, scattered through time. In low consciousness these other selves are unrecognized. In higher consciousness, our awareness permits communication to multiple selves through precognitive sharing, the consciousness of the earth itself, and multiple races of beings from other worlds in other parts of the galaxy and universe.

The _I am_, as the incarnate life form, occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages. One, the consciousness is in the brain-heart-gut. The brain-heart-gut complex links to the central nervous system. The central nervous system connects the entire fascia system through the vagus nerve -- the central nervous system connector -- as part of the DNA communication system. Two, consciousness is in the sympathetic nervous system (SN) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN). Three, consciousness is in the entire neural pathway network, fascia, dermis, hairs, the entire system. It connects to the gallbladder which is intraconnected to the vagus nerve. Every organ is intraconnected and interconnected to the vagus nerve.

The skinsuit is part of the individual and collective experience. Our life forms are on all different levels of awareness -- planetary, solar, galactic, and universal. Contemplate the vagus nerve aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole. The sympathetic and parasympathetic are our local space-time. The sympathetic drives our daily actions when the soul is in the body. The parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states, or when it is fully in self-defeating programs. The sympathetic can also be self-defeating and kick the spirit out of the body. It's driven to resolve karma. It guides us like a compass to choose a variety of karma out of the free will. The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole, our ancestors, and to the South Pole, our future generations. We need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have. Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body. A sympathetic example would be road rage, rebellious energy for the most part. When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul, the ego and the shadow have allied with each other to manifest an internal villain, a bully, so the soul can't be in the body. In Jung's psychology the subconscious looks upon the sympathetic as fight, flight, or freeze, and it looks upon the parasympathetic as rest, digest, and relax.

Entanglement is the measure of how much consciousness is in control of the body. It is measured through the vagus nerve, the sympathetic nervous system, and the parasympathetic nervous system. The subconscious rest, digest, and relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority, taking back our power, and purging the vagus nerve. Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with our consciousness, we can flow it directly into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. This is how the incarnate life form can retain lucid dream creations. This explains why people run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming. It's difficult to make rich, high-quality memories. The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to mystical experiences. The sympathetic has neural pathways designed to use the five senses. The five senses sum to the sixth sense, the totality of the experience.

Think of a violin. The parasympathetic system is the body of the violin. The sympathetic system is analogous to the strings on the violin. The vagus nerve is the bow. Consciousness plays the violin. The consciousness of the earth itself is the conductor. The parasympathetic system is the resonance chamber. These things are useless alone. The string is nothing without the bow. The vibration is nothing without the hollow chamber resonating with the body of the violin. The fine-tuning relates to how much the soul is in the body.

The consciousness of the planet hands out the sheet music, the larger composition to which the individual instruments contribute -- the blueprint of synchronicities. The planet is the interconnection so the skinsuit can have an experience with the planet. This may be alone, with individual family members, cultures, religions, anything in the sheet music provided by the consciousness of the planet. In this orchestration, we seek harmony to make direct signature frequency matches. The planet simultaneously exists in the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness. The planet's celestial mind is the medium between these two levels of awareness, as well as the planet itself, manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a set of unique experiences. This applies to every planet in the universe, with only a few exceptions. The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us, the life forms, as well as intraconnected with the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness manifesting in physical and non-physical space.

We want vagus nerve, sympathetic, and parasympathetic sovereignty. This permits intraconnection and interconnection to our celestial minds. The journey is in maintaining sovereign connection as an ongoing experience until the experience is second nature. At this unfoldment, we can achieve other forms of embodiment. We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement. We can create versions of ourselves in other places, spaces, and times. This is our legacy as multidimensional and multi-functional beings. We can adapt the form to communicate with other places, spaces, and species. Sovereignty is earned when the soul can leave at will.

DNA was designed so when we reach a certain frequency we are no longer solely within the chemical experience. Chemical exchanges are fundamental to the life forms living in this third density. Our journey is from chemical to light. The water -- the fluids -- that comprise the atoms of our bodies becomes a resonant amplifier. Light-based experiences happen through the refraction of water. The soul is the light inside the body. The water and fluid are refracting it by chemical reaction. When we shine light through water or a prism, there is no chemical separation of the prism of light. Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time -- orgasmic experiences, love, and fundamental experience without thought.

The entire experience of death is set to change. Our lives will go to three hundred years, five hundred, seven hundred years in one go. The passing over experience will persist to finish this era of light's karmic accounts. Our capacity to plan future lives with twenty to thirty percent of our life memories, hundreds of millions of years as our database for mapping future lives.

We're not put on our mother's heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord connected. This is the natural law of harmony. Birthing in hospitals with _licensed_ medical personnel and limited bedtime due to economies of utility does not complete the first synchronizing of the child. Our _I am_ technology has to come out quickly in our body in the present system. Everything is set to slow down. The future will see more natural birthing. Pregnancy will be between nine and twenty-five months.

There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them. They might be ahead of time and lack parental guidance. The fetus in the womb planning is set to change as well. The mother and father will co-plan the spiritual journey before the fetus even enters the womb. It will be light-based planning from the outset while fully incarnate in this third density. This is multidimensional living. This is the great leap forward, no offense to Mao Zedong. He had the concept right. It was the context he lacked. A whole new human race is ready to step out of the chrysalis of time and spread its magnificent and colorful wings. This is the promise.
