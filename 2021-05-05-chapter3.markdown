# Awakening Journey

We live on a seventh-dimensional seed planet. Earth can teleport itself through time and space and seed worlds. These seeded worlds created by our planet, earth, are blank sheets. They have no Akashic Record. The life force seeded by earth allows the new world to start growing with its Akashic Record.

When we reconnect with the source, we become celestial mediums of peace. We start using the womb chakras to create. This was earth's original plan. This planet seeds life and brings the celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system. The celestial mind extends spiritual contracts to a sun. The sun extends its contracts to the life force. This connects it to the galactic celestial commerce market.

Awakening is kindling of the awareness strand of galactic commerce through celestial minds, using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time. This allows the ocean of awareness to go into the sea of consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a solar system. A solar system is an energetic or a physical being within a world, there to experience the strands of connectivity.

The earth was created for the unique experience of spawning new galaxies. That was the design and intent. The opposite has occurred. The earth was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm through the time travel wars. Source connection became the greater mission. Our sound and light fractal, our dimension, was hacked. We were set upon the worship of false gods. They have been numerous and continue to this day. It's no coincidence that a spiritual leap forward has begun in the age of technology, even though science itself is godless and the global narrative is anti-god right now. It's the change itself, the gap between the two programs, that allows the window to open a little on our reality. The misdirection or harvesting of human intentional energy is the basis of false fractals of the divine hologram. It's a multidimensional expression of building our prison. We are co-creators. Even if we've forgotten that they haven't. Our intentional energy is a harvested resource, psychic equity in dimensions we pretend don't exist.

Our mission is to experience the infinite ways the soul connects and disconnects from the source. Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn soul disconnection. As we disentangle from the system of domination and control, from past lives gone awry, the more we can step into the understanding of true soul connection. There are people on earth who planned hundreds of lives to be here now to assist with this process. We can call this the resistance of free earth. They're here to find the soul codes among all of our species and complete them. Domination and control could no longer keep us separate as soul families with a complete soul code.

The consciousness outside of time we can call the ocean of awareness -- the universal hologram -- and it has the individual universal experience within. The universal experience becomes a being on a planet who slips into forgetfulness to experience finitude within a larger evolution. The consciousness flow in the ocean of awareness allows the data to go from wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience. The ocean of awareness is the implicate order. There are different oceans of awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations, and reincarnations. Not every universe uses incarnation. Many don't use _I am_ technology like ours with seed and egg technology.

The ocean of awareness is part of the intricate waveform to which quantum physics refers. It can be collapsed into particles. Every particle can again be broken down into sub-points of observation. The particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously based on what we choose to observe through it. The ocean of awareness generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram, but we perceive the hologram at different levels of awareness. The particle can be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in this lineage that is this particle on this planet, but it is also part of a solar system, and this makes it a bigger particle, and this fractal expands. Our local hologram is one particle. We are particles inside one particle. As individual particles, we can perceive the next particle -- the solar system particle.

There's a specific fetus agenda from lifetime to lifetime. The _avatar_ agenda evolves the greater soul's ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of _I am_ expressions who have been fetuses. There are times where the over-soul -- the avatar -- gets looped in servitude to a system that lowers its capacity to use light, and, as a result, it cannot expand.

A non-agenda being occurs when time is irrelevant to the great experience. Linear time is not the focus of the agenda. It may do one thing twenty-eight thousand years ago, seventeen things two years ago, two million things forty-eight million years ago, and that, technically speaking, is a non-agenda. The things done in the non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas stuck and unable to move forward. Non-agenda allows us to cut and paste time-based experiences out of certain _I am_ experiences and use them temporarily in a new _I am_ expression to manifest past or future non-agenda aspects into a present agenda.

# Agencies

Agency is a fascinating word. It's a third party that facilitates exchanges between other parties. In the early twentieth century, agencies normalized. They had always been around, but the province of kings and emperors only. An ambassador is a form of the agent, brokering for the centralized power it represents, nation, empire, region, or province. Most of us didn't engage with agencies before the great leap forward in the global narrative -- the Gutenberg press plate from the fourth dimension -- the Industrial Revolution. Now they affect our lives profoundly. Agency was taken up by the global narrative in full vigor. We have advertising agencies, public relations agencies, the agency around a leader, mitigating decisions and influencing outcomes with counsel and diplomacy. Agency is everywhere now. Most people might think agencies are human inventions. They are not. Like all things we bring into manifestation, they are existing aspects of the multidimensional reality we exist within. The utility and function of causal agencies are the same as terrestrial agencies -- a third party that facilitates exchanges between other parties.

Cosmic agencies are made from energies of existences outside of time and the _I am_, which is finite in time, as each instance of an _I am_ is finite. It's part of the incarnation package. Our past lives are _I am_ instances. Agencies work with the _I am_. They're kind of like non-physical bureaucracies. It's quite astounding the bureaucracy on the other side. The dimensions can be a regulatory nightmare. The bureaucracies we have on earth -- large corporations, departments and ministries, police and military, almost everything in the modern world -- is a reflection of an internal multidimensional bureaucracy. As above so below. The cosmic agencies facilitate karma resolution. They close contracts.

Remember what we have discussed already in this book. Karma is any utility of energy to manifest, prepare to manifest -- as in thought -- feelings which demand manifestation, and, of course, actions, which, in a conscious person at least, are the product of thought and feeling. Incarnation is all about contracts and karma. It's planned out in the fetus in the womb. Agencies facilitate the contracts. If you come from another spiritual tradition, perhaps it's best to regard them as agents of the lords of karma, or, in a Western model, the agents of fate and destiny. It's important to understand our full self-responsibility as sovereign beings. We are responsible for everything we think, feel, and manifest, where manifestation is the fulfillment of creation, tying off the inner and outer worlds, the imagination and reality.

Agencies are not always operating at the highest standards and practices when compared to something like the precognitive workforce. Let's say we have a chunk of karma that has to be resolved at a high frequency. We have to work with low-quality agencies to resolve karma. We can terminate cooperation with an agency and agents outside agencies. Culture is an external factor that influences the themes of agencies and agents. The agency is our first point of contact when we are a fetus in the womb. Together with our higher self, it is responsible for creating all spiritual contracts for this lifetime. The employer of the agency is the human, the _I am_ of this lifetime. The employees -- agents of the agency -- are the various _I ams_ who represent the many expressions of us in the unseen, so we are our agency, a compendium of past and future _I am_ expressions, just another testament to the power and creativity of this creation, and how we are very much a part of it at all stages and expression, the only variable being our awareness of it.

Agencies don't always work in unison. They're subject to the same power plays we see on the earth. They sometimes try to take over the agency. Us of today was once a fetus in our mother's womb. The fetus knows it needs a variety of experiences to plan infinite potentials. It works hand in hand with the agency to make a series of contracts that fit our karmic resolution. The more efficient the agency works, the more often we reuse it through our many fetus plans. Some of them are low-quality agencies. They can mess up the matching of our _I am_. Often an agent has worked with several other _I ams_ and has a good working relationship and reputation.

The fetus comes through the birthing canal and enters the great forgetting. The child starts unfolding its awareness around two years old. It's no longer directly working with the first point of contact in the agency alone. The _I am_ baby is settling into the new DNA skinsuit and is learning from the parents and the environment. As babies, we have full access to the vagus nerve which means we are still connected to the mystical side of this existence at a larger level.

The vagus nerve is like a control room. It operates the body with its special skills. The _I am_ is housed in the vagus nerve with access to the entire consciousness of the DNA experience. As the _I am_ gets older, it works with different levels of authority within the agency. Often at puberty the _I am_ fires the existing agency. The _I am_ says: _I have to be a sovereign being in this lifetime and as such, I need to take back my sovereignty from all these I ams represented by the agencies_. Most of it happens subconsciously. The level of hormones drives us during puberty. The _I am_ apex presence here and now has the power to boot out other _I ams_ if they are trying to run the agenda through the _I am_ apex by corrupt agencies or soul families. Agencies can also be shared by soul families.

A bankrupt _I am_ is someone who gave up the responsibility of creating their reality. They handed over authority to the programs and former _I ams_. It could be a person in a post-life review who chose not to cross over right away and hung around as a temporary ghost. This creates a longer form of shadowing and fractured soul shards. When finally crossing over the _I am_ no longer has a point of contact to assist with the life review and future fetus planning. There are times when a living person has become a bankrupt _I am_ or has given all authority away.

The _I am_ apex has the power to out-create itself. An _I am_ at any point can go into the vagus nerve and begin the journey of self-mastery, self-healing, self-nurturing, and kick out the negative programs that are in there. There are times when we give authority to a protective part of us, a program, a self-created demon. It takes authority. It says, _I get to work with the agencies you don't_. It does not give us any indication, no memo or email.

When bad things happen in our lives we are usually not in our _I am_. We're not fully in our body and vagus nerve. We're not in the driver's seat. False synchronicities can be created when an _I am_ has too many soul shards in them. The soul shards begin to take over the _I am_ spot in the vagus nerve. They contract with the actual agency in unawareness of the _I am_ that has made the original contracts. To step back into the mighty _I am_ apex takes daily practice.

Agencies can work in multiple time-space equations. Agents inside the agency are certified to work in time and no time. Some agents work with other non-certified agents of other time-space equations to force a match no matter how minute it is. Agents and the agency are separate entities. Think of them as independent contractors who are contracted by an agency to do the work. Some agents are full-time employees and some are outsourced contractors, akin to when a bank sells a product and bets against what they're selling you. Even though the _karmic resolution machine_ has run its course, we as beings are still attempting to reincorporate our fractured selves, our traumatized and charged perspectives. This allows the agencies to use those traumatic experiences as a perspective for matching us to let go of karma and work towards dharma.

The agencies contracted out in the womb are still working with us in the now, but as long as domination and control still exist, where we are forced to accept tens of millions of layers seen and unseen, we will be dealing with agencies and contracted agents of agencies who have three degrees of separation from the responsibility for the destruction they cause. The _I ams_ working against us can be resolved with contract revocations, shamanic work, and the daily practice of self-mastery. We all have parts of us that work for the domination and control agency. We have _I ams_ that work for thousands of different agencies throughout the universe. High-level shamanic work is getting rid of the one-star agencies to only start working with the five-star agencies. Low-level agencies have a very low standard of a signature frequency match. Higher quality agencies have higher standards of match-making. The agency is here to help you write a contract on the fly. That is the best resolution for all sides. Low-level agencies look for lower levels of resolution to get their quota.

The vagus nerve is the universe in realized potential. The _I am_ must learn to drive the vagus nerve like a race car driver. The Schumann resonance is the speed limit. The agencies like to give us speeding tickets without authority to slow us down. There are construction zones where the _I am_ sets up a building phase and at times the _I am_ creates a rebel who screws up the plans. This is when traumas take over life planning. The fetus gets shut out of this part and tries to get itself back into trust with the _I am_. These are the blame, shame, guilt, and fear agents that exponentially get worse with age. Faith is a key component to understanding the levels of separation.

Loss of faith and trust is loss of control of the vagus nerve. Once we lose control of the vagus nerve we are in a self-made crisis ruled by hesitation and doubt. When there is no coherence between mind-heart-spirit, there cannot be a resonance to the seen and unseen world that is trying to align synchronicities to us without us being paranoid about them. We start attracting low-quality agencies and the Schumann resonance is there to determine how powerful and potent we can be throughout an era or slice of history. It is only the agencies, or self-created internal programs, that put out the speed limit signs. The highway goes in every direction but we still have to guide ourselves with confidence from point A to point B, which is the resolution of conscious awareness at the level of responsibility as an _I am_ of someone who is fully realized in the vagus nerve on the superhighway of the self. The speed limits can be seen as programs that need to be taken out or considered as data and input to learn and evolve. Conspiracy theory is an example of speed limits to slow us down. The system of domination and control is a low-level agency. Agencies have different levels of practices and standards.

Let's say we want to go into spirituality and not do the nine to five work life. We deliberately put in a construction zone to limit the speed of any programs that may want to take us off that path. It is how the _I am_ sets up the discipline of the self. Many spiritual paths say our lives are written before we are born. It's true. They are _outlined_. Our free will decisions inform the outcome of the blueprint. In classical Greek thought, we have the notion of fate and destiny, a reiteration of the eastern adage of the life outlined before birth.

Our journey to self-illuminated master means we can't let our programs influence us to make hasty choices that don't work in our long-term favor. Programs bring up a subject matter. They have charge and polarity behind them. When we give into them the program in the vagus nerve is running us and not the _I am_. The planned construction zones are all about frequency, vibration, and harmony. They aren't necessarily a bad thing. They're here to help us on the path. There are deconstruction zones where a person has had lifelong trauma and needs to stop the traffic, completely tear up the roads, and create a detour so there's only one new neural pathway from which to choose.

Agencies will look for how present we are so they can match us with a being of similar resonance to our time-space equation. This is what we can call time syncing. Once you are in time sync with an agency it can contract for you -- people, places, things, objects, art pieces, anything that can create an experience that manifests a memory with lasting expressions. Astrology has a big part in how the agencies can work with us. It builds on what sticks in light memory or trauma memory and from there a blueprint is formed. The system of domination looks to predict us the same way and tries to get us to work with its corrupt agency.

A spiritual strategy is an agenda in your time-space equation so that things can naturally time sync with you and you are not forcing them. Often people can't find their perfect mate because they are trying to force matches. It's a pure energetic thing that does not have a cognitive function behind it. The purpose of the _I am_ is to make conscious things in a time-space vocation, to have access to its vagus nerve, equal to its level of awareness so a series of experiences can transcend chemical memories. Those chemical memories become powerful light memories that allow us to remember things about us during the great awakening, part of the ascension into higher states of being while still present in this world.

The agencies in the world are no different. They're expressions of the universal principle of agency, a third party facilitating an exchange between two or more parties. Madison Avenue and the age of advertising brought the agency to full expression. Our society needed to reach a point of complicated interdependence before fully formed agencies could appear and have such force and sway in the world. The advertising agencies create demand, which requires supply, which demands borrowing, which catalyzes money issuance, which expands the economy, which appears to validate the whole process. Man-made agencies are very destructive for the most part. Money itself is an agency, but that's not the limit of its magic. It's also its hyper-exchange. It never stays in position very long. It's even being offered a digital corpus now, a true form and world to exist within.

The other big area of the agency is public relations. That's why famous and busy people have press agents. Public relations is the agency that edits the global narrative. It's not that they lie; it's that they choose which questions to ask and which questions to answer. Without publicity, nothing happens big. So public relations is geared to making the biggest noise in the most controlled way. These are the absolute masters of complicated context and detail configuration for narrative support. We might never catch them in an outright lie, but their failure to live the law of truth makes them dubious agency for us because of how detached they are from the consequences of their actions. We can think of a dozen things in a second, the brilliant crafting of the Clinton defense -- _I did not have sexual relations with that woman_ -- factually true within a self-defined context, and why? Because the person asking the question didn't clearly define sexual relations, so he used his own, then the blue dress blew away his self-defined context and brought it into communal context -- he got his dick sucked in the Oval Office, and he doesn't consider it sexual relations because there was no penetration, and it only took several weeks and millions of taxpayer dollars to arrive at that stunning conclusion, all televised on CSPAN, like some funky mix of the Roman Coliseum and a Colombian daytime soap opera. The manifest agencies are here for the global narrative. It's their system. It creates its agencies, and those are their agencies. It's possible to push this understanding into the other dimensions and very easily understand what bad agency means in brokering a life.

The last form of agency worth noting is the agent assigned to you by the state for a legal defense. In bail court, this might be a low-level public defender. If the charge is more intense, say murder, then you might pull a defense lawyer with some clout, someone from a private firm who takes the public defender wage contract and acts as your lawyer. This is a dire form of system agency and mandated by the system itself because it knows you can not survive without an agent from their conceptual world, their jurisdiction. This is the world of agencies, here on the earth, and in the other dimensions, too, operating under the universal principle of agency for the resolution of contracts in the world and karma imprinted into the sound and light hologram throughout ancient past, immediate present, and the unrealized future.

# Entangled and Unentangled

As we move past a subject, part of our brain continues to color in the past event, as if it were a live memory, until we completely disentangle from the subject. We do it all the time, so much we don't even notice we're doing it. We go to a party. We have a good time. We synchronize with the moment. Upon leaving, the energy of the party persists in us with a kind of half-life -- still thinking and feeling the fun we had at the party and _coloring_ the memory until our consciousness disentangles from the energetic imprint.

We want to stay with high-frequency experiences, but we get disconnected. Sleep can disconnect us. An argument with a significant other can alter our frequency, but, even a few hours after the argument, it was still a fun party. Think of a kite and the wind that suddenly reconnects to the energy.

Our state of perception influences us. When we _think back on_ the party we are in the _implicate_, _enfolded order_, as opposed to being _at the party_, where we are in the _explicate_, _unfolded order_. The state of perception -- implicate or explicate -- determines how we perceive the physics of the environment. The physics of the environment, as well as the observer's perception, changes as the observer moves between explicate to implicate order. The state of perception equals perspective. The perspective of the explicate order -- when we are at the party -- is different than the perspective of the implicate, the memory. No matter if we are spiritual, atheistic, or anything else, it's all quantum mechanics expressed in different words.

The entangled observer uses a deeper information process, while, with the unentangled observer, the information is in full flow, and there is no need to process it -- it's already in their knowing. When we have infinite love co-creating with us, we must truly choose to be the disentangled observer. Go into your heart space. Create that vision in your mind and engage with the sacred, neutral observer, knowing information cannot change us unless we agree to it. Based on how the _I am_ now is understood and processed, it will either expand or contract your knowing. By making that sovereign choice to be the disentangled observer of the self means we get the fullest versions of ourselves in the here and now. You are the apex of your hierarchical order. Say that in your mental heart space.

> I am the apex of my hierarchical order and no other hierarchical system has control and domination within me.

The entangled observer, going through the process of perception and perspective, is refining the thought structures. Every time we have an _aha_ moment we go from implicate to explicate. You can be an implicate unentangled observer and be in the explicate observation simultaneously, but entanglement is a deeper choice to enter into it.

In this reality, there are no real truths and facts because every time we go from implicate to explicate and back the memory has changed. This is what shatters space-time as the foundation of everything and creates the plasticity of reality. Consciousness does not adhere to space-time per the rules of Newtonian physics. Why would it? Consciousness is not of matter, but it can exist within and experience matter. We've been over this. You are a supernatural being who stopped being super and has been convinced it's not beneficial to the natural world. Did you get that? They're telling you you're preternatural, which is disconnected from the supernatural implicate and the natural explicate. They are trying to write us out of creation, void our contract with creation, erase us from time by convincing us we should never have occurred. It's random, don't you know, this evolution thing, this natural selection thing. A random thing has no plan, no order, but not to worry, from that chaos they can bring order.

Thoughts and memories, even as part of the implicate and explicate order, are a chemical frequency in nature. There comes a point in light frequencies where we bypass the chemical frequency in nature, and we operate in a higher dimension where space and time are no longer relevant. This is the temporality of time, the impermanence of it. Space-time is dependent on how the implicate and explicate order goes to chemical and light memory storage long term. This is when the DNA instrument of experience can have a three hundred and sixty degree view of itself. Spiritual contracts can become part of the implicate and explicate order. This creates the time stamp on the linear side of the life form, or, the DNA instrument of experience. It also creates adherence to the global narrative. The past, present, and future are irrelevant based on perception, but it is the perception that gives it relevance at the moment when the chemical memory becomes a light memory or, in the case of high frequency, when we bypass chemical memories to create an experience. The status of entanglement determines the outcome. Quantum physics works on the premise that everything is entangled. It places all significance on the observer without looking at the observer status of entanglement.

An unentangled observer may be implicate and explicate at the same time. You don't have to have an explicate explanation as a prerequisite to the implicate order. Every time the quantum field is accessed and observed, the access and observation creates a marker point in time and no-time that the implicate and explicate order is no longer defined separately but viewed simultaneously. We can call back all marker points in time to which you are a fixed point in space-time for spiritual resolution.

When we become a fixed moment in space-time all of our simultaneously existing selves can tune into our finite point in time. Those particular marker points in time could be many eras of light apart, or they could represent a marker point in an era of light in which we became an apex of our DNA lineage of registry. You could liken it to puberty -- that would be a marker point in time. The era of innocence ends. The adult with miles to go before it sleeps, and promises to keep, to borrow from Robert Frost, emerges. It's a marker point in time because a greater form of time stamping is created. Sound is a form of light. Light makes up memories. Memories can be changed. Yes -- memories can change. We can change our memories. We can change our past. This is the power given to every one of us, but few access it in a lifetime. It's just another forgotten part of the grand being we call soul.

The study of mnemonics is incorrect. Scientists understand the chemical part of memory, but not the light part. Past, present, or future memories are all frequencies of light. When we watch a video it is a slice of time. When we create a document or read out loud with power, these are slices of time.

This is what these revocations are for and if you read them from the heart, from a place of power, expanding the wholeness that is you, bringing the fullness of your sacred discipline, your sacred genius to mean what you say. Read them out loud as often as you can. Once you have found the power in your voice, record them. Listen in a deep meditative state. Hear your version of power. Present your signature frequency to that past incarnation of you and raise that frequency, that emanation of light, through sacred discipline and choice. These are choice points, markers in time. They project to a future version of yourself who may not be in that power or ready to get to the next level.

Introduce yourself to yourself with this method and you begin to learn you are your greatest teacher, you are a signature frequency match for what you focus on. You are a match for great change when it has potent concepts behind it that directly connect to you. By way of these tools, powerfully applied in the physical present moment, we make a conscious choice to be the unentangled observer, to interpret more data and data sets at a superluminal thinking level, enforcing our sovereignty as divine co-creative celestial beings of the now.

The unentangled observer is not attached to information or its flow. Until we become the unentangled observer, we impact situations purely through observation. We create another neutral observer external to us after this. We create it inside the divine hologram. We raise our light frequency to create that anima part, reaching towards the celestial medium journey, increasing our frequency until we are the celestial medium. This hasn't manifested in the human information field yet. Nobody in science or spirituality is talking about it.

One might very easily have questions about judgment here. How do you participate in family, community, economy, government, and world affairs as an unentangled observer? Suspend judgment. Judgment is an attachment to this divine hologram we are born into. It's also a petition for experience. This is our unconscious understanding of irony. To detach we need to practice the unentangled observer. We can achieve a non-judgmental state, non-competition, equal co-creation, with non-hierarchical order. It is our natural state.

Judgment is a very unique perspective. There are certain high states of awareness that use judgment. Judgment is an ongoing challenge all consciousness is going through. Making something absolute is necessary to solidify concepts, but it can prevent greater states of awareness. Judgment is required to materialize concepts from the sea of awareness. This is another way of looking at materialism. It's not all just cash and cupidity. Certain highly aware beings are very judgmental. They've gone so far into concepts of good or bad it's their way or no way.

An unentangled observer can observe the quantum field without affecting it. It happens all the time. Observers are born into human form, sent into this world to create a record of it they then take back to where they came from. They do not interfere with the unfoldment of circumstance here. If they did, they would be entangled. There are numerous observers and collectives of observers that we might call off-world, able to observe us nonetheless. They are not influencing us, but they have a perception of us based on the observed data that is put back into their form of experience -- their body if you will, like the human form for us -- or what we can call, however _clinical_, the DNA instrument. The experience is taken in as a flow, then perceived after the time of observation. This allows them to remain unentangled observers because they are two degrees of separation from the original observance. The DNA does not influence the observation because of the two degrees of observation from the observed. It is our birthright and legacy as human beings to do that too. The more degrees of separation the easier it is to become a quantum observer. As we unentangle ourselves from everything that will give us the choice to perceive from a place of non-definition. DNA has a light frequency in it beyond our understanding. Our consciousness can engage the unseen world and by using mystical linguistics our knowing can expand. As an unentangled observer, no charge, no polarity can influence us. You have the unlimited point of view, in sacred neutrality where all information flows as an experience in expansion of your knowledge. This is when the mystical becomes the norm.

# Near Death

Near Death Experience (NDE) is an excellent way to illustrate the light versus the chemical realities. It's a living example of a middling experience between chemical and light memory. They are part of the spiritual contract to allow us to see who, what, and where we've been in the lifetime since our first breath. It might also be our past and future lives intersecting. We often meet our guides, guardians, and others in the NDE.

The body has to go through the trauma of the death ritual. The aura somewhat pops and the contained life force starts leaving the body. After the pop, there's a vacuum of energy. The body must produce more etheric -- chi, prana, orgone, to name a few monikers it goes by -- energy and maintains it to stay alive. The final breaths use the body's last alchemical fuel it's had from birth. The brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs. The organs remain a part of the divine hologram. The _I am_ begins to disintegrate its structure. We go back to the ocean of awareness. We may have attachments to who we have been in previous lifetimes. This triggers life reviews and direct healing of the body. We connect back into the original blueprint of health. Some people have visions of places and spaces of potential to refill the soul's capacity. Going through this transcendence phase, it's vital to maintain the auric bubble around ourselves. If not we drain out our life force energy.

We can come back from an NDE as an educated, illuminated being. Some people come back with abilities they didn't have before, the ability to play the piano, for example. It's a change in spiritual contract underwriting the incarnation -- a new set of DNA-based purposes. This is not a walk-in experience. Walk-ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.

NDE experiences take us out of time-space equations because we move into the ocean of awareness then back to our life. Once we lose connection to the organs, it's just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through. We are disconnected from the hologram because we are no longer supported by the aura. You can't maintain the internal energy flow. It flows out of the body. Once we lose the bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules. We waver between many different worlds, including the ocean of awareness as our ancestral connection. The sea of consciousness is more for the many dreamers traveling back and forth, contracted with us on linear and non-linear scales to ensure we stay invested in an era of light and don't check out before our time.

As we leave time and space, depending on the kind of NDE we have, we can go to a high-density dimensional realm. This is when the fetus in the womb had a grand goal not yet achieved. We can be sent to seventh or eighth density to experience life from there then return with some of those potent memories intact. Often people are overwhelmed by the experience. They are overwhelmed by their light being. It becomes an expression of their self they fear they can not live up to. We can live the light body. It's already who we are. The NDE shows us that. Those experiences are contracted out in the fetus womb plan.

Bystanders sometimes accompany the soul when meeting loved ones on the other side. Life reviews can be seen as random moments, even though everything has an underlying universal order. When one has a life review as part of their NDE, it is about the spiritual contracts, help to grow beyond them because the soul, in the internal and external infrastructure, hasn't been able to resolve the issues. The fetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences, including the NDE.

When doctors or nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body it can be the etheric, the life force leaving the body at the end of the transition process. This is a verifiable phenomenon. The energy has a light mass. The body is twenty to twenty-two grams lighter after death. It all depends on how the life and death experience is planned in the fetus. Some people have mystical deaths. These deaths are another way of assisting others to mend broken faith.

Out of Body Experience (OBE) is generally astral travel. This is markedly different than an NDE. The astral body has an intact auric bubble to store chi within the hologram. In a life review, the _I am_ perceives incidents from all different angles because of the dissipated life force. The life force in the incarnation is the foundation of the _I am_. We may experience the pain we've inflicted on others as if being in their bodies. It can be quite dramatic. Many experiencers report an array of thoughts. Thoughts have an electrochemical frequency employing the body's base electromagnetic frequency as a storage system. This is how we create time stamps. In near death experiences, the body releases those energies. This is why the thoughts come to our awareness. An infinite being in the ocean of awareness can still experience these feelings as part of death.

Physical reactions help us acknowledge and resolve experiences once we return from the NDE. As the body takes the last breaths, a chemical reaction persists for as many as seven days. This is attachment. The death process can be dragged out in letting go of these attachments. In many mourning rituals, the bereaved stay with the dead body to honor and witness the letting go of all the karma and dharma as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased and the bereaved.

The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be bypassed. We all must do it. On the verge of death, we don't necessarily remember what to do. Some people understand death as part of the journey and have prepared for it. Some people are in fear and panic over death. Our guides and guardians assist us to begin the life review regardless. Sometimes things we have deliberately avoided our whole lives come into focus. An understanding of the preciousness of life is recognized in the dwindling of consciousness.

Death is a new beginning. It's a change of energy and consciousness. Don't be afraid of it. Our choices in this life determine the ease we have with our life review. The understanding of death expands consciousness and takes away fear. Death is an acceptance to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets.

We don't necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available when going through a life review. When the life review starts, the soul is shattered into thousands of shards. The oversoul comes in and puts them back together, takes out the negative soul shards, and puts them into a secondary file. Another fetus from another womb uses the soul shards to integrate it into the infinite fetus blueprint choice so the shards can get resolution in another lifetime. Soul shards are not the _I am_. The oversoul guides lifetime after lifetime.

# The Literal Metaphor

Observation is also implicate order awareness. The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallization process. Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the ocean of awareness -- another bloodline influence example. Free will is tainted by the bloodline. We grow additional strands of awareness. The ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness crystallizes and changes the bloodline at a certain level of acceptance and integration. This is the journey of the celestial medium -- _I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium. I no longer need to grow in this narrative. The next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network._

We are hypothetical beings. We can believe in many things. The universe determines what manifests through our wills. Hypothetical becomes _I am_. It's realized through engaging our belief engines which allow strands of awareness to influence intuition -- precognition and post cognition -- without competition or hierarchy. A multidimensional being manifests into this third dimension through created tangible experiences co-created with the infinite celestial medium. The incarnate life form is the expression of the present, the here, the now.

Epigenetic urges influenced by memories often keep us from creating new experiences. We have lived billions of incarnations. We must disconnect from them and reconnect with the source. This is the way to create new memories, which is part of the awakening journey. We sometimes over-identify with aspects of our evolution. Identity as myth is rarely explored, but it can hugely influence the way we experience life, and how we create in it. The more we identify with one part of our journey -- grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums -- the more we limit ourselves and inhibit our access to the possibilities of the many divine holograms. Buckminster Fuller immortalized the phrase -- _I seem to be a verb_ -- when it came to considering identity.

> I live on earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing -- a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process -- an integral function of the universe.

Identity is a strange thing. Thought is not static, it's a process of movement. Different metaphors in our belief engines change the very nature of the internal representation. By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective, we can change the way we identify with it, gain clarity and ease on how we interact and work with it. Ask -- _what does celestial mediumship look like for me_: a ship that helps us sail through the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness, a vehicle we sit behind, a building we construct? It's all about the unique way we internalize the subject matter to fractalize the strands of information, enter it into cognition, and realize it in the here and now. Talk in pictures. A metaphor may be alchemically internalized as an expression of a multidimensional, multifunctional being of photonic light.

The theories with which astronomers and scientists explain the origins of the universe are bunk. Most hallowed information in the public space is disjointed. We might get the right details in the wrong context, the wrong context with the right details, or any number of percentages of either. Deception is a long practiced craft on this planet. It's a dividend of the great forgetting, the disconnection from source initiated by our birth on this planet. These deceptions, largely centered around information anemia -- plus a host of techniques to lower our frequency -- create and sustain belief engines. This has fractured the unity between cosmology, science, and spirituality. They don't want a unified knowledge system. Knowledge is licensed and sold back to us. It's a slave economy, but the belief engines inhibit this realization.

To understand the complexity of creation, a unified view of the holographic nature of reality is required. This exists outside the linear and beyond scientific sets of equations. We first need to understand time. Time and the nature of reality as a holographic system that evolves adapts, changes content and rules, and simultaneously updates events in the past, present, and future. Time is a social agreement -- a paradox with different timelines, time genocide, creational and non-creational events -- and, as such, the history we know it is incomplete, falsified, and subject to change in the years to come.

We need to look at time from the bigger perspective. The consciousness of our sun continuously expands. It's the total sine-wave of consciousness that represents our solar system, and it's spiraling around the galactic central sun. This means we can go a little faster. Time gets redefined at this point because our concept of time is very distorted. A time frame stated in a book is not a reliable reference. Time does not work linearly. History changes depending on what timeline we're observing. Time is a social agreement. How many calendars do we have in this world? We entangle with many variations of time: universal time, Greenwich Mean Time, Daylight-Savings Time. Time is no longer a universal concept. When we look at events in the past we need to take time travel, timeline genocide, and hijacking of events by time interference into consideration. The time wars have been centered on power, control, and dominance.

# Language

The DNA skinsuit converts light into sound through consciousness to create memories. We perceive, receive, interpret, store, and express ourselves in words as codes, multidimensional patterns we call language. We may know multiple languages, speak in one language but process and think in another until we become fluent. A skilled linguist can speak seven or eight languages and easily switch between them. Language is a form of communication, consciousness being expressed verbally, emotionally, and physically.

The written word is light information stored in ink. It may take hundreds of thousands of years for the data to be perceived as light again. Language is a choice beyond cognition. It is the currency -- a current energy voltage going through us. It is a medium to express ourselves. Sometimes many currents are going back and forth, an opera, for example, singing and dancing to accentuate, punctuate, and make the language more robust.

We think in perfect sentences. Nobody remembers learning to speak their first language, their mother tongue. We struggled to find the perfect sentence, but it all made sense in our heads. The light that is the pureness of our consciousness knows what it's trying to say, and it translates from light to sound. Syntax and sense can be independent of each other -- _colorless green ideas sleep furiously_. It does not have to make sense to feel good. A word is not a creation. A sound is. The light can be modified with intonation to create more light. Martin Luther King said, _I have a dream_. Out of context, it's superfluous. In the context of a unified world, it allows the actual intonation process to create flashes of light. They create more flashes of light.

We can create light with our speech. Grammar is sentences flowing together to create a sensation, the breaking up and assembling of the words, the nouns, the pronouns, so we understand the mathematics of creating a sentence in English at that particular time. That alone does not make you a good talker or writer. You still have to be able to authentically emanate the words.

It's more like the nature of teaching. Language is spatial awareness. Grammar and syntax are the way consciousness adds intuitive wisdom to the statements themselves. It adds more to the code. When you look at words as sound waveforms we can see patterns like DNA intertwinement. We exchange DNA light at a higher perspective level. DNA changes through observation, the interaction between different types of consciousness. Everyone allows a different layer of change. Words are powerful. Incantations are words. Prayers are words. Mantras are sounds.

Certain phrases can put a shock into a person's system. Words can place us on the path of understanding or cast us out to outer darkness. Mythology is the potency of language memorialized. All the ancient myths were oral. The storytelling was the entire bureaucracy of the tribe, preserved and performed by shamans with the full authenticity of their voices. Joseph Campbell unpacked these myths to form vast maps of the unconscious. He distilled them all down to the hero, the central myth of all cultures. The hero is a light bringer. The light is new knowledge. The bringer of fire, the means to reproduce fire at will, was a hero in his time. They told stories about him for generations. Fire was a big deal. The story of the fire starter carried his light forward for generations as people huddled around fires at night.

Language has its consciousness. Children are in a learning state as they grow. They are exploring words, places, positions. They have focus and a strategy as they understand placement, position, and timing. If we hit an annunciation perfectly it creates a euphoric feeling within us. There's an actual dopamine journey behind owning that fluent form. Where there are no barriers, the language becomes instinct and pattern recognition.

A child is listening long before they are speaking. There are subsections within language. A thought in a conversation is fluid. We don't know what we're going to say next, but we have an intention when we continue a conversation. It maintains a conscious state of focus to continuously translate light into sound. It creates a lasting memory so we can understand the nature of our conversation. Thoughts can be stimulated by words. A new language is a mathematical journey of structure. Mastering the body's annunciation and conjugation journey by using intonation, the starting and stopping of the nasal process. There is a mathematical formula to mastering the tongue, nose, throat, and lips, and how the innate body language of each language affects the intonation journey.

It is an understanding of how fluent energy works together with all those pieces and parts. The inhalation of air from the lungs, the trachea, the larynx, the vocal cords, the force of the tongue, the nose manipulating the sounds to make intonation resonance with the lung. Certain words resonate from the lungs to the nose. The subtleties on how the wind forms in the lungs and is being used are intricate to the language. All of those mechanics make learning a new language difficult.

The tongue is the second organ that gets created. The heart is first. The tongue takes the vibration directly from the heart and sends it to the tip of the tongue so the heart's vibration is the base of our language. The tongue emanates an energy that we perceive in light. The position and placement of the tongue and teeth create a piezoelectric effect on the teeth, producing an electromagnetic effect in the body as unseen energy of expression. The roof of our mouth has three plates that determine how chi is spread through our bodies. If they are tight, with a sunken nasal passage, there's an occupying presence taking away from the greater us to express. The sinus along with those three plates creates a vibration that is our expression. The tongue works like Morse code, tapping and creating electromagnetic signals the brain receives as language. The heart sends the language through the tongue. The brain receives it. There are conversations in which we go beyond the five senses, into a holographic perception of the language suspended in our consciousness while we process it. Some people process faster than others. Slow processors understand the subject matter better in the long run. They don't allow themselves to be overwhelmed by the data or over-process, and they don't miss nuances.

Humans are analog speakers trying to achieve a dual process. We are analog and digital thinkers. Off-world species no longer operate in binary coding. They think from multiple perspectives. It allows them a greater understanding of the unlimited point of view. They are waiting for us to come out of the limitation our language imposes on us. The global narrative blocks language from evolving into multidimensional thinking. The entire body gets involved in communicating. Words make up the least significant part of our rapport, less than ten percent. The rest is expressed through our tone, tempo, timbre, volume, and physiology, as in posture, gesture, breathing, facial expressions, and blinking.

We often use hand positions when explaining dense material, using the streams of light in our hands to examine the field and the strands we want to connect with. It is like moving the sheets of information around to get to the specific data faster, a way of determining sub information and how that affects the whole. It is almost like we are using the hands to complete a spiritual process. When we speak light language it's through the throat chakra. All of our senses observe the vocal patterns the reality is observing through the throat chakra. The knowing is in the heart. The completeness of the manifestation is in the voice -- the throat chakra. We are setting a tone and frequency.

People might not speak a language, but they can still intuit a body language, an auric field interacting with it, and the psychic information which is the sign form of light language. Speaking light language uses all parts of our body. The final manifestation is how the reality interprets it as an observer or an unentangled observer. Light language can speak to unentangled observers and be unentangled, yet it still gets the point across. We have the right to speak with them.

The _I am_ presence is the apex of this hierarchical order. We can use our words of command to be in dominion or communion with beings. When our light bodies are calibrating more with the _I am_ presence, languages through our soul and voice box become easier. The translation is free flowing with harmony in which several phrases before you speak light language can get changed and modified, the expression of photonic light. We are giving codes to light itself to change an expression, like a kaleidoscope opening and closing a specific pattern. We can make multiple sets and patterns throughout the entire conversation. It's almost like we remember how to use the frequencies of the voice intonations to affect reality. Every communication is multidimensional. An expansive communication is based on the broadcaster and the receiver looking at the match of the three-way forms of interaction of frequency, vibration, and harmony. When we speak a multitude of beings in the past, the future, the seen, and the unseen are listening. A high-frequency statement is low in harmony. It creates powerful sparks, not necessarily in the now, but later, for the people listening in archives and beyond.

It should come as no surprise that the controllers are heavily invested in language as well. The main tool of human agencies -- advertising, public relations, and law -- is language. The false god system is held in place largely with language. It's highly charged emotional language the creates a susceptible state and then the ideological template is fitted into that opening.

Political language is highly legal, seeking to incite feelings without committing to hard promises. Slogans are big too -- build back better, hope and change, make America great again -- again, an example of inciting feeling without a clear working intent for the emotion. This is energy harvesting at a low level, national, provincial, and municipal. However, it is disclosed energy harvesting. The politician discloses the political goals and we have a choice to lend our energy or not.

We have to commit our energy to this world in some measure, no matter how much zealotry we see in renunciate communities to the opposite. If you live in a group, you have to give part of your energy to that group. It's true for families, lineages, communities, states, countries, the world, the solar system, and the galaxy.

It becomes more about honesty, directness, lack of corruption, and sincerity, but the political class is bought before they even get to the office. Believe it or not, one of the things that will wake the most people up is the growing awareness of this corruption in our systems, and, most importantly, our language. It's not natural for human beings to lie. That's why we feel a little knot in the solar plexus when we lie. When this feeling goes away, and a person is so accustomed to lying it is their new normal, something vital is taken away from the person. They may finish their life, but they have created a karmic imbalance which has to be balanced. Language is a great gift, a disembodied spirit we all share. It should never be abused. All words spoken should be honest, from the heart and the tongue, and to affect your true purpose, which should be the best outcome for all parties as a result of the parlay.

# Entities and Demons

A program may or may not be consciously entangled. It all depends on how life force empowered the program is. The more we are out of our body, letting the program run us, the more it's entangled with our vagus nerve. The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills. It creates confusion about what is the soul and what is the program. Some people's bodies are controlled and run by programs. They take over the vagus nerve. The _I am_ is unaware. Once programs take over we are susceptible to entity association. Entities can take over the programs. Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs. Entities might not know they're being run by karma. It is easy to get lost between what is internally created and what is external entities.

Ninety-nine percent of entities are self-created. One percent is bonafide haunting. Not everyone is meant to work with entities. There's an intuitive factor to knowing what to work with. If we don't have the intuitive factor built-in we should not be in that realm. It's curiosity learning. It happens when we let the programs run us. When we are curious about something we are not the neutral observer. Curiosity itself has a charge and polarity. We are controlling a subject matter. It's right at the edge of the unknown. The brain fills in the unknown before it's known. People want to know and are falsely drawn to it by paranoia. It's a vibration in them saying, _I need to know about entities so they don't invade me_. They might not have had any around for months, but the curiosity draws them.

There are certain forms of energy we might confuse as an entity. They're just shards of us. They initially were part of the story we created, then they turned into internal programs when the story was empowered by charge and polarity. Trauma can develop from a scary story. It doesn't affect us or turn into full-blown fear, anxiety, or paranoia. We can go back to the original story we over-created, see the tree of creation for what it is and release the trauma. A lot of people need help to get back to that source. Not everyone can do it on their own. Certain people with ancestral DNA switches turned on don't have the capacity for that self-inquiry.

There are times when the story is so strong the entity takes over the life force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle. As healers, we have to slow down. We shouldn't go beyond the match of our vibration. The house always wins. You never know what's next when people are possessed. We are the alpha entity, but self-defeating habit patterns make our potential a low match to high vibration. Getting out of shame, blame, and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.

When we are speaking to someone run by an entity we usually talk to both. We speak to them and the entity simultaneously because the person is both an entangled and unentangled observer in that scenario. Make the entity come out to a conversational match so we can speak to it. The client can be a fully unentangled observer listening to you talking to the entity even though he or she is using her vocal cords to respond to its thoughts.

When people work with very low-quality agencies to create, they often use us as a signature frequency match to get others into their web. They find it difficult to be on their own or need instant gratification and constant validation for their ideas and creations. As a healer or teacher, we will see that a lot of people falsely match themselves with you. When we know it is a false match, we can use it to our advantage and not create karma. Depending on the power of our vibration, if potent enough, their alter ego has to retreat and their _I am_ can feel the vibration. The altered ego is usually a chicken shit. When the _I am_ has to defend its actions, it shows us how misaligned with its sovereignty it is. We have to maintain a high vibration not to let chaos define the keynotes.

Shattered shards of _I ams_ are either bankrupt or fractalized _I ams_ unauthorized to deal with an agency but still take on this responsibility without our authority. We all come across these forms during the healing and teaching journey. Take someone who has been sexually abused at a young age who uses an altered ego to protect themselves emotionally. Then they go through healing, and they no longer need that shard, or, they use chemical drugs and create more shards, demons, vigilantes falsely protecting them.

An external demon is a life force that has not crossed over. It maintains itself as a surface bound energy spirit, draining the life force from others. It cannot produce its light. It could be an _I am_ that did not want to pass over, or an off-world being that could live thousands of years but lost its capacity to maintain a single body. Its _I am_ can create new bodies temporarily, but the vibration of this world doesn't allow these bodies to stay in existence long. This is why it possesses other bodies.

An internal demon is the result of intense trauma. The story becomes so big that the character goes into the vagus nerve and the subconscious empowers it to be the potent being, then it becomes the dictator, tyrant, and abuser through addictions, self-defeating habits, and self-sabotaging mutilations. The person's internal demons try to dominate and control the external demons. External demons often run as internal demons can be very strong and destructive.

An implanted entity is a powerful demon that has thousands of ways of harvesting energies off us. They control many minion demons much younger under their hierarchy. It's well documented in CS Lewis's _The Screwtape Letters_. It will implant into you, and its job is to pretend to be your inner higher voice until you won't be able to distinguish what is your voice and what is the demon's voice.

An explanted entity is something that has been put inside you to create a signature frequency match and then purposely ripped out to create a drama. Once outside of you it still vibrates on your frequency, serving as a bait line to lead you down a track of false synchronicities to negative external sources.

Inculcated entities are advanced puppetry -- you don't know who or what is pulling the strings -- a very old external demon source with lines into thousands of minions feeding up the tree.

A clone has a spark of the person in it. The spark has a similar spiritual contract pattern to the original being. It's against sovereign free will rules to collect an entity's DNA and make a clone of it. Cloning against someone's free will creates a person that is dominated and controlled with little or no sovereignty. This would enable other sentients to take over the body at any point. The vast majority of the world's trade beings are genetically built with a suit for consciousness to broadcast from one planet to another. That suit can be inhabited for some time and then put into cold storage for later use, or they unmanifest the body, travel energetically to a planet and manifest a body there.

Running into a fully depressed person can be tiring. It's important to know when you speak to the person or a program, an internal demon. When the person is in the body, the programs are shut off. Sometimes external entities can still come in. There are people with powerful external or internal entities in them who are subjugated. We can hear it in their voice -- how meek they are. There is no power in their voice.

# Source Connection

Source connection is living in the light worlds, the worlds above the elemental and chemical, while grounded in the body, finite and infinite at the same time. We disconnect to contrast being connected. It's an aspect of the lesson here -- disconnection to understand the connection. We see this fundamental duality of the divine hologram everywhere -- the yin and yan of the Tao, Carl Jung's extraordinary work on duality and the shadow, the juxtaposition to the light. Not many voices have clearly articulated the disconnection teaching before. The thread of life goes everywhere in the universe, and that _thread_ has a connectivity bandwidth exponentially beyond fiber optic, and yet we, this human race, underwent the sensation of disconnection from source as an experience. Realize what that means. We're like Chilean miners trapped in a collapsed coal mine. That's how the connected species in the sentience circus that is our galaxy see us, hardcore. As we have steadily moved into self-awareness as a species, propelled as we were by Gutenberg, the Western enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and, lest we forget, the iPhone, we have seen this disconnection in the collective mind. It rippled through with French Existentialism as chic twentieth-century philosophy, spurred on by the First World War, no doubt, the trauma of it, the horror of it all. One of the earliest portrait's of this dislocation would most certainly be Mister Kurtz, from Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_, the perfect literary tone struck for the twentieth century, published in 1899, a harbinger if ever there was one. We are here to experience disconnection from the source. Oneness has no meaning if we don't understand the disconnection journey first.

The disconnection fractal is achieved by controlling the mind. People don't take a moment to realize the enormous changes the human race has gone through since about 1890\. We now live in a completely man-made reality. We travel in an enclosed environment propelled by a tar plumbed from the earth. We have face-to-face conversations a thousand miles apart. We can drive past digital billboards in city thoroughfares. The Greek amphitheater is Netflix, HBO, and the cable channels. Stonehenge is Joel Olsen on a big sports screen, and the sacred is now profane. This is spiritual conquest. This is a disconnection from the source. Every artifact of our organic culture has been incorporated and sold back to us. Yet, by reasons only explainable through cultural or regional programming, we think it's unjust that Beijing select Catholic Archbishops instead of the Vatican, and reincarnated Rinpoches instead of the Tibetans. Regional and provincial narratives are more and more folding into global ones. The global narrative teaches us false science, false time by galactic timekeeping, false history, and belief systems which long ago should have given way to tangible and productive wisdom and knowledge traditions. False light is a multidimensional technology commonly used here. This is the source of disconnection.

Superluminal thinking leapfrogs chemical experience as the basis of memory and consciousness. Let's look at it backward through photosynthesis. A plant eats light and excretes oxygen. Human beings live in a chemical experience until light enters consciousness. It's the reverse of plants. We consume elemental material here, calories, an inherently chemical process, aided by a long digestive tract, and we use this energy, the fuel for the human experience, an integral part of our chemical existence, to find the light in our consciousness. Creation in a dual pole, free will space can often be navigated by bookends, opposites, even irony as a conceptual understanding of the thesis, because the opposites form contrasts, and, in a light based divine hologram, without contrast we would not even discern the reality around us. You see your reality, your wife or husband, your dog, your car because the environment has light. The light finds pockets and reflections, and it finds places it can not go, and from its presence are all forms etched.

Superluminal operates beyond the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The vagus nerve is fully functional. All the chakras are open and interconnected through the central nervous system. They are part of the superluminal experience. The body adds the sensation that it can't process, but it knows it's the unentangled observer in superluminal thought. The body grounds us here, but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one-millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed. Then we go out and do it again and again until our cup is filled. Superluminal thinking is more than we have learned, read, and studied. It's knowing going to the next level, the next apprehendable sphere of experience. It's subtle. We won't have conscious cognition of it. Everyone has experienced it. Our level of practice will determine how fast we can apprehend it. How is that possible? You're already there. You just don't know it. You are unconscious of it. The unconscious mind is connected to all knowledge. The conscious mind creates a manageable data flow so you can persist in the illusion of the third dimension. This is the basis of the Maya teachings in Buddhism. Illusion was perhaps the wrong word. It's more like a projection of light refracting through the atmosphere, the projection itself emanating from the source of all our realities, the place without sound or light that is neither dark nor silent, Kabir's riddle.

The sound and light is all sound and light, not just what can be experienced within the human sense ranges for hearing and sight. All these inner worlds and universes, if they are at all apprehendable, are sustained by sound and light. Anywhere these two persistent emanations of the prime creator are present we find contrasts and then forms and then realities. It's this simple.
