# Foreword

```
    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
    The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    Are full of passionate intensity.
    Surely some revelation is at hand;
    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
    Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
    Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
    The darkness drops again; but now I know
    That twenty centuries of stony sleep
    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
```

## There is Something New Under the Sun

I have to admit that when I was asked to write the foreword for this text, I was a bit taken aback. The first question I asked was, _Is this going to be another New Age book on how to expect good things and then good things will magically happen?_.

Knowing Andrew for as long as I did, I really should have known better, but after reading this text, I can now assure my compatriots in the Esoteric and Academic communities that there finally is something new under the sun.

My skepticism speaks to a growing problem within our beloved esoteric community where the new iteration of the _spiritually aware_ have been literally hijacked by social forces and are now practicing _spirituality lite_. _Things fall apart_, indeed! This version of _diet spirituality_ in the age of social media diatribe has been the cause of factionalism within the spiritual and holistic communities. Gone are the days when deep thought and the patience it took to realize the great truths of the Universe were a staple in spiritual practice. Google and weekend courses have replaced epiphany with participation certificates and 0.07 microsecond enlightenment.

Then there is this text. _The rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem to be born._

Yeats could not have described the situation better in his poem when he implied that this rough beast would eventually bring a pause to a situation where _the best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity._

Inside this text, resides the seed of all aspects of sublime truths which many have been seeking in extremely obscure and often downright confusing sources. The old guard of spiritual gatekeepers may want to dismiss this book as more _fluff_ mainly due to their earnest belief that spirituality must be an exercise in suffering, a figurative labor of love which lays the neophyte spread eagle on the ground crying out in the darkness waiting for revelations to be birth from sacred orifices. I would invite these brethren to pause a while from the regular spiritual masturbation and self-flagellation which has characterized them for centuries and step away from the Lodges and Mystery School manuscripts and read this work because this text is a distillation of truths, we know to be correct; but presented in a way which is accessible to the profane. Save the birthing process for future incarnations.

I also speak to those with social media attention spans to consider what they lose without reading. Indeed, it is said that the man who can read and does not read, has no advantage over a man who cannot read. I would invite the new-agers and keepers of _The Secret_ to stretch themselves into a space where expansion is not a hit or miss affair. Indeed, it is a wonderful thing to stretch the mind and the spirit along with the body, so please pull out the yoga mats and open your heart chakras to a new reality.

## My Knowledge of the Galactic Historian

Andrew Bartzis, the Galactic Historian made himself known to me three years ago when I was, for want of a better word; _sleeping_. Many years of being a practitioner of Esoteric Philosophy as well as a mentor and teacher to students of the Eastern and Western Esoteric traditions had created a sort of spiritual burnout, where I sought refuge in the darkness of an apartment in Oakville Canada.

A choice visit to Barbados would put me into contact with the Galactic Historian and I knew instantly when I met him that this was not an individual who was a _dabbler_ or another _light worker_ in name only. Subsequent discussions with Andrew revealed that he was the recipient of what he called _downloads_ which were at the basis of most of his teachings.

Being a natural skeptic, I had to engage in many discussions with him to realize that he was not just pirating teachings which have been leaked on the internet from truth peddlers who sell discount versions of truth in the marketplace of ignorance, but he was indeed authentic.

Since this time, Andrew and I have developed a dialogue and a friendship which has been of great relief to me. It is important when one is on the spiritual path to have a community of individuals to use as a sounding board. All too often we become locked in our own limited ways of thinking which can be expanded if we allow others to see and point out our blind spots and call us out on them. This is the true dharma which escapes many of us.

In this book, our author has given us a multidimensional helicopter tour of Ontology, however this is not the kind of helicopter ride you are meant to come down from, neither does the tour end after reading this text. This text is meant to engage the reader not as a passive recipient in a one-way communication field but as an active participant in the dialogue of what makes his/her existence what it is.

There are several facets which the book covers. It covers Galactic History sliding along our history as we know it and it rails against the status quo of established ideologies. The author has meant for this to be a bumpy tour and so it is.

For those of us who, in error have mistaken the _shared illusion_ which we have come to accept as the real reality -- even though physics has, through evidence proven otherwise -- this book will be a helpful reminder of how our attachment to this illusion is what creates the fragility in our spiritual practices and beliefs.

This hologram which binds us into this shared understanding is challenged and a new narrative is formed often quite hilariously in the text. What if we treat the hologram like a hologram? What if we treat this reality like the alternate reality we so often refer to as our dream states? What happens then, dear reader? Does society fall apart? Or do we gain permanent insight into a creation which is less confining than our collective experience.

Further, how does one express our concept of free will in a reality where we literally see what _others_ want us to see and experience. This conundrum forms the basis for an argument for making this shared reality an alternate reality, that we choose to engage in consciously as opposed to the idea of _a real existence_.

This chain of questioning and internal dialogue, written in a stream of consciousness pervades this text and challenges our concept of creation. It is easy for us to believe that we were created by some arcane and powerful force which watches over us and protects us. Others believe we are in a co-creationist universe which has no will except evolution. All of these vague concepts represent really ornate ways of saying _I don't know anything, and I don't think I'm smart enough to figure it out_. If you have given up on your ability to _figure it out for yourself_ and you have surrendered your intellect and dignity to the hologram then this text might anger you somewhat because it will challenge your comfort levels to wake up and start exploring meaningfully again.

This natural inquisitiveness which many of us have put to sleep is the cause of much disharmony within and without the hologram. If spiritual intellect was a river flowing directly from the mind of god then surely the end of curiosity and wonder is the stagnation of the will of god itself; and our religious friends know all too well what happens when we are cut off from the creator: _the falcon no longer hears the falconer / And mere anarchy is loosed upon the world_.

These troubling insights are explored in this text in no vague way. What Andrew has done here is become really specific with the limits of universal law, the application of it, and the consequences when it is broken.

Our concepts of karma, the universal credit system, our corporeal interfaces and the actual interactions which govern the processes of co-creation are explained in minute details.

I would personally advise readers to read this text more than once as the revelations contained can help with understanding everything from the rising gas prices in your locality to why it is you get sick.

## On Secrets and Secret Societies

The value of this text is revealed in its universal application. Too often, we get caught on opposite sides of the spectrum of our understanding. Either our heads float off into the clouds of obscurity or we dig ourselves a grave in the mundane nature of the hologram (cue the crystal healers). Complete awareness however requires us to have our heads in the clouds and our feet on the ground and this we have seen is the mystery of the hexagram from our venerable brothers in the Martinist order.

For a very long time, we have seen the divide which was artificially created between the _older_ knowledge of the mystery schools and occult fraternities; and the new age spiritual _drive throughs_ which have been producing _enlightened beings_ at discount rate.

Many in the old guard of occult knowledge have looked at this development with shock, horror and quite often disgust and have refused to see that their reactions to this belies their own insecurities that their beloved practice and its significance may be coming to an end.

The world has changed and we too must change if we are to continue these great traditions.

Part of this change should be the acceptance that we do not have all the answers and that maybe, just maybe our understanding of the universal order may be flawed in many ways.

Too often our judgment of this new version of spirituality misses the mark in understanding that we should meet people where they are and get rid of derogatory statements such as, _Men of the Stream versus the profane._ We are all in this artificial matrix which this book refers to as the hologram and having ten sets of keys as opposed to one set of keys does not make one less imprisoned, if he being of an exalted nature, still cannot open the door.

## The New Age Gurus

I believe this movement has been a reaction to the often oppressive and hierarchical structures put in place by the old guard. In the new age movement, which we will classify as everything from Crystal Healing, to Reiki, to the modern forms of Yoga, everyone is good enough and everyone can participate in the spiritual fair.

There are of course positive and negative consequences to this kind of thinking. The latter being that even if we are all equal, some still believe that they are _more equal than others_, to paraphrase a popular novel. So, we have an example of a popular figure in women's empowerment referring to herself as the _Alpha Goddess_; which in itself begs the question; Where is the final word, and who do we consider the _Omega goddess_, if this is the case?

While her self-appointed title is amusing, it highlights the underlying problem with new age philosophy which simply dispels the need for critical thinking to any high degree. Many of the proponents of this movement have made critical thinking an enemy and an institution of male-centred oppressive ideology which then gives license to engage in flights of fantasy and self-delusion, a condition that is extremely destructive to their understanding of universal principles.

If this isn't bad enough, the hijacking of this movement by social forces such as feminism, social justice movements, conservationist movements -- who all came to this path with the best intentions of creating a better hologram -- have made the factionalism even more complicated.

The resulting situation is that we have the blind reacting to the blind, leading the blind, and they all give more power to the hologram through active division.

My brothers and sisters, it is for this reason we need teachings such as the ones represented in this text, which seeks to transport your perspectives outside of the hologram fueled by personal bias and false light.

Our understanding of the universe must begin with our understanding that we are our own jailers and that the realization that we are self-incarcerated should prompt action.

Our author's helicopter view invites us to stop thinking in simple patterns, sowing division amongst ourselves as a distraction from the fact that _we do not know how to get out_ and choose to admit, like the first step in the journey of an alcoholic, that we have a problem.

We are addicted to the hologram. We are addicted to false light and false teachings and we are addicted to the self-created dramas which plague our existence. All in the worship of illusion.

What a glorious day it would be if we decided to excavate ourselves from limiting belief systems and think wider and higher. The Galactic Historian invites you on such a journey to the realization of this goal as a self-imposed crusade out of the _holy land_ of ignorance and into the realization of higher forms. This is an open invitation and one not to be dismissed for the true seekers of answers in the universal order.
