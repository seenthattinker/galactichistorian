# The Event

The event happened in 2014\. It was a redirection, a subtle move by the prime creator to avoid an end game with the fifteen multidimensional beings. The best way to think about the event is as a seed. Once planted new opportunities present, though few will recognize them at first. They will be that subtle, only for the truly astute to notice. The background architecture will open to its original purpose. The powerful will become weak, hunted -- the predator will become the prey. Here on our timeline, there will be a lot of chest-thumping, a movement so swift and deliberate to militarized policing, dictatorial government, all alongside a steady flow of information which will let the public know what's going on. Belief engines will collide like locomotives running head-on into each other. It will appear as though the wheels are coming off the world. The farther down the dystopia tunnel people are the harder the event will be to endure. Primitive people will adjust more easily, people close to the earth, because the earth is going to take over the show.

Earth will manifest herself to take over all physical transactions between people. There will be a true energy exchange system in complete transparency. The earth sentience is the judge. Everything in the public debate now is nonsense. All _isms_ are expired. They were only relevant to the old consciousness -- carrot and stick. The whisper in the wind now is _renewal_, though what it is, beyond its general concept, is undefined. People will take their last breath. They will leave. When ready they can send another part back, not to the dead being, another being who can project and exist here.

As soon as we graduate somebody takes our place. We have a big graduation coming. The graduating class is going to create free-willed versions of themselves who go back to earth to teach the new people. It will be in a free-will earth environment. When we are right and balanced the Pleiadians and Sirians get released from their contracts as well. They can finish their changes, too. Even the Grays are held up. The whole ascension process is held up by this bottleneck created by the fifteen families and the resulting time wars. There's a slight problem in that the fifteen families who created this mess are also part of our soul family, the rotten part. We're not at the state that our consciousness is unified enough to truly understand the depth of what has been done to us. Without help, we never even would have known we were a race with amnesia. Their crimes were perfect, undetectable by all save the prime creator, and extracted from the fabric of creation, as though they never happened. It was like defining shades of black or looking for light in the darkness, but it's always been there. Nothing can be hidden forever.

The people who come in will change the earth to be more multidimensional so that earth can return to its seventh-dimensional galactic seed planet status. The graduation includes moving to the seventh dimension. Wherever we end up and we'll also be able to communicate with each other. We never have to go through that horrible feeling of fragmentation and isolation and all that other stuff that's been going on for millions of years.

The old Lemurian air cities will become our new dream cities. An air city is a group of sentients that put their energy together. They unmanifest a body, put their energies together and make a functional vessel reality-drive energy vehicle that can be anchored in the space in between air molecules in the North Pole.

There is a council of twelve energy beings who sit on the spiritual courts of equity, ensuring soul families can't resolve issues. Earth has been removed from the process by technology. The system was taken over and corrupted. The event balanced the system in 2014\. Many of them were swapped out for the prime creator's walk-in wildcard.

The equity is being re-balanced. The main council of twelve does not have bodies. They can use an octopus system to go into multiple entities to issue controls to the system. They use puppets. Only the prime creator oversees the council of twelve. He did this with the event. A timer started. A deadline came into the game. They feel it in their lineages. Every breath they take is now measured against a deadline. They face the mortal dilemma now -- tick-tock, watch the clock, time is no longer the measure; it's the meaning. It's profoundly unnerving for them.

For those of us ready, indeed patiently waiting, it will be like a new dimension has opened up. The backend architecture the prime creator reconfigured will only filter authentic experiences here now. The false will begin to stand out, but it will be the last to know. All the actors will be unaware they are not connecting with the audience. Whatever they used to get by this long, it's not working anymore. The energy exchange has changed. They know it. They don't believe we do.

It begins in dreams. The dream weavers will come back. We will begin to share sacred dream space. The ages and vibrations people grew up in will be reflected in the dream space, the astral worlds. As that first wave comes the kids and the senior citizens will suddenly see eye-to-eye. Generations will be one of the first separations of densities. The elderly might realize they're kids, young spirits, and revert their age. Some kids will realize they're much older and age very fast. Some adults will become the new elders. Some will try the process to get out. The choice is teaching or learning.

# Ocean of Awareness

There are beings who no longer use any form of birthing technology -- pure unentangled quantum observers. They can use any seed and egg technology to generate different forms of _I am_ technology. This is how the fifteen multidimensional beings were abusing the universal laws. They knew they could splinter themselves into thousands of _I am_ experiences and remain unentangled observers by various degrees of separation. They were wholly unentangled and conscious energy beings using the laws of incarnation through technology. In the ancient past cloning technology was easy to use. They could incarnate into a dog, a rabbit, a cat, anything really, and remain the unentangled observer. The DNA instrument determines the richness of the experience for the unentangled observer.

Transmigration is the spiritual term for leaving the human form for a lower form in the incarnation pattern. It's usually presented as a punishment or admonishment to better behavior, but, after performing war contracts in an incarnation, a cat incarnation disconnects the being from the implicate order of repetitive karma and allows it to have other lifetimes of incarnation separate from the karma created in the war. By leaving the implicate and explicate order and becoming a completely unentangled observer in the natural food chain -- a separate karmic interaction -- beings of the past created karmic debt that was put onto lineages. The debt was no longer connected to the being but their lineage. That's how lineage-based debt was created. It's an insight into the sins of the father being upon the sons doctrine in the Abrahamic scriptures. Some beings used the unentangled observer technology to escape karma. They escaped their karmic responsibility by leaving karma's chain of custody and scapegoating their future generations.

In the ocean of awareness -- the living algorithm of life -- all data is conscious. We become the living algorithm of life when we are in a DNA skinsuit that is regularly achieving near super or superluminal thinking. The algorithm is a fundamental part of the _I am_ everyone has experienced it, technology unfolding as you grow older and become more experienced running the DNA skinsuit at its higher functionalities. When you act as the living algorithm of life within superluminal thinking, you create a signature frequency where others can palpably sense the meaning of your delivery. Being fixed and not fixed in time. In this refined state of being, we enter the energy frequency that is the living algorithm of life. We stay grounded in the body and explain things in the twenty-six letter encoded English alphabet. We all do it. Most won't realize when they do it. Often clarity comes in dream space because the mind is out of the way. The celestial medium of peace is functioning in many scores of dreamworlds, with many of the precognitive and post-cognitive workforces creating the language of masterful manifestations through visions. The data, as part of the waveform, works as the precognitive workforce to manipulate how it will be perceived at its endpoint in space-time. The ocean of awareness is the technical source point for the flow of data that may or may not generate into the sea of consciousness, an observable time-space reality. It allows the data to flow to the sea of consciousness in a fixed time-space narrative which then allows consciousness to observe it. Consciousness in the sea of consciousness can be both entangled and unentangled, manifested and non-manifested in time. In the sea of consciousness, quantum physics becomes confusing. We are still in the ocean of awareness. Part of us might still consciously entangle with the ocean of awareness as a greater observer as space-time narrative. This is how the angelic forces work. If we go back to thousands of eras of light, when the universe was not as big as it is now, with perhaps two hundred galaxies in it, the ocean of awareness was a very small network. To know itself through a sea of consciousness, it generated a seventh-dimensional galactic seed planet -- earth -- a place where the ocean of awareness could directly manifest, change, and adjust the laws of quantum physics through entangled and unentangled observers. It created matter-based lifeforms on mass scales to populate new galaxies, part of the greater exploration of where light can go into the void of experiences. Lifeforms went to the ocean of awareness to find meaning and to create agendas in the sea of consciousness. The source can be observed as a hologram through the egg and sperm creation. All of the information is already there to form new parts of the hologram through new life experiences.

Data is a finished algorithm. An ongoing algorithm is the conscious processing power CPU of the chemical memory being made into light memory. In the journey of becoming a solidified chemical and light memory, it becomes data. The observer ends the journey of processing the perception and turns it into a perspective before it moves on to the next subject matter. We know 1+1=2, but when you're a little kid trying to figure out math the brain slows down. Once you have the answer that ends the process. Having an affirmative answer then becomes a solidified DNA memory in light -- transcendence -- accessible through knowing, easily accessible to your awareness during pattern recognition. There are times where the information is at the tip of your tongue but you can't get it until the time you stop thinking about it. Pattern recognition can trigger the memory from before.

# Water and Weather

Water is programmable. As we learn to imprint on the water we can give energy to the oceans. We can acknowledge all ocean species and marine life. We're at a time where we can do great healing to all sentience on the planet. We are that majestic. The ocean flows through its tidal mechanics. It's a waking dream meditation on the ebb and flow of energies in our reality. We can use tidal energy for intense releases. We can create with it. Focus our awareness with full intent and presence to the intensity of the energy. On the way out allow all our distractions to flow out. Use the potency of the ocean for masterful manifestation. Give the water our voice. The water will carry our voice to the full length and depth of its volume, and all the tributaries, rivers, lakes, and deep aquifers throughout the world. Water can carry our voice. Acknowledge all ocean life in the prayer process, the ocean itself, its life force. Sync with the tidal motion. Confirm your feelings for the programmed water. We experience a whole new dimension of understanding. Water is the most valid history on the planet. It bears witness to all. It's the record of things at an elemental level.

Our planet has had its water stolen over hundreds of generations. Global disasters have been planned and executed to redistribute the ancient water. It was imprinted by high-dimensional beings whose purpose was to protect the earth. The catastrophes sought the deepest water in the earth -- the primal water deep in the earth -- and brought it to the surface. They reprogrammed the water with false light technology. Water has been taken off the planet by trillions of gallons. It's planted on other worlds. Earth's water is replaced with polluted water from another planet. The earth is used to cleanse it and clear its karma. That's right -- we've been used as a galactic water filter. It's the height of abuse and indignity. What chance does our system have for evolution if we're used as a drive-by laundry for bad karma?

There's a race of beings on the planet who live in the oceans. The Merfolk community holds the records of those thefts and dirty water dumps. Water is a rarefied commodity. It's more valuable than anything else on the planet. There are countless water discovery projects on earth at any given time. There are groups on the surface into it, and there are inner earth races also looking for the reserves of the ancient programmed water. Our deepwater reserves were programmed by the founders. Are you starting the get what's going on here? The commerce, the human traffic, both physical and astral, the larger web of commerce that is a galaxy -- we're sitting at a poker table semi-consciously, not realizing we're the mark among players who make the barest placation to any notion of free will. But it's changing. The Nietzsche adage that anything which does not kill us makes us stronger is about to take on a whole new meaning in the twenty-first century if for no other reason than the facade of death is going to pass from the human experience. It's part of the limited consciousness manipulation that has been going on here for too long to say aloud. Immortality begins by realizing the body is only a state of being.

A hurricane has low pressure that affects the physical body. It forces more electricity through the auric field. It can create anxiety if we don't know what to do with the energy. Shamans of the past were weather manipulators. They could harvest the energy and invest it in the land. It could nourish the soil, grow better crops, heal people, or the energy could be redirected back into the storm to invest in the next year's harvest. It was a spiritual economy. It still is. It's a spiritual economy wallpapered with fiat notes, debt instruments, and perpetual servitude. How can that be? A spiritual economy gives unconditionally because the chief characteristic of the prime creator is love. Where does the debt come from? When you peel back the wallpaper over our economic reality there is no debt. The only collateral against the notes issued today is the labor of national populations. The wallpapered economy has us borrow against our productivity and pay interest to various private-public third parties. It's an energy harvest.

When we are in tune with the weather we can become the storm. In harmony with the weather, we can ask the elements to shift the clouds. Instead of moving a storm, we can add our energy to it to balance out karma. Every drop of rain and gust of wind is a balancing of energetic karma. We can bring our blessings and purity to that storm. The veil between realities is thin when a storm moves through. Thunder and lightning are an energetic manifestation of pure spirit on the physical plane. They are an acknowledgment of the sound and light hologram here -- the conductor stepping forward to bow to the audience. We can tap into the energy of storms themselves and increase our fertility by putting the wind energy into the sperm and the egg. Both partners can guide it to connect through the storm. The background electromagnetic radiation and the energy of the storm create the fertile communion. A storm can be a portal. The soul is already there.

Electromagnetic frequencies are created in a flood. The water strips electrons from the surface as it moves. This increases the speed of the water. A dam break creates a rapid flow of water. Tidal energy rolls into the shores of the world. Hurricanes push the water inland, as do tsunamis. They're both rapid releases of electromagnetic energy. All these occurrences have wisdom and bring treasures. On the unseen side, negative entities get swept away. Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a massive purge of five centuries of ghosts. The city was never the same after Katrina. The ghost communities had figured out how to harvest the land and the people. The energetics of the hurricane destroyed their psycho-spiritual ecosystem, their economy.

# Signature

We are _I am_ self-driven waveforms in a bubble of reality. The physics of it all adjusts you to our harmony, vibration, and frequency based on our ability to propagate life in equal co-creation and non-hierarchy with our celestial counterparts. Our signature frequency is a naturally evolving attraction process coherently aligned to the seen and unseen world by raw vibration, frequency, and harmony.

Our agencies work at the universal source level. We are universal beings resolving universal karma at any moment in time. Collective consciousness is a limitation -- we've got to think beyond it. Like creates like. Dislike creates dissonance. Our consciousness gives consent, but the universal frequency, vibration, and harmony can match us without our consciousness entanglement. We have to take responsibility at the level of awareness to become a coherent vibrational match. Whenever we're trying to cognitively force a match we're not in the state of emanation allowing the natural ways of the universe to naturally fractionalize and align synchronicities, harmony, vibration, the frequency with you. As long as we are trying to control the outcome we miss the experience.

Polarity takes us out of resonance with our natural frequency. When we feel everything, we have the heart overwriting the mind, or the other way round, and they're no longer in resonance. Sovereign neutral is a state of observation with no agenda. It's simply there to perceive the information, cognitively understand it, but not create stories with it in the present moment. We can use the information and create a story afterward with our post cognitive workforce. The sacred neutral point of view is a living experience. It has the potential to create powerful chemical memories. They can become powerful light memories we can go back and look at in a non-sacred neutral state. Remember, though, we can retain or go back to certain memories only in the sacred neutral state. When we are the pure sacred neutral observer at the edge of knowing, a magical flow of data is accessible to us. It's a state of being that requires trust. The _I am_ is one hundred percent in the vagus nerve, the central nervous system, seen and unseen, sympathetic and parasympathetic, all programs shut off, the experience creates powerful chemical and light memories. They affect our being in the past, present, and future. It's a state of true creation. Finding passion through the infinite unlimited point of view puts us on the edge of the unknown, making it easy for the unknown to become known.

When the TV is playing in the background the frequency of the TV impacts us on some level. The background noises irritate us. We might have to pay attention. There's a time-space stamp on it misaligned with our internal time-space equation of Roman numeral time. Everything on TV is recorded in the past. Most live shows are on a delay. Frequencies are light and light is technology. Any type of light wave can interfere with our lightwave production. We are unsecured technology. Unless we understand our potency, the need for sovereign boundaries, and the _I am_ apex fortification, we are far from acting as secured technology.

Harmony is related to space and time. Frequency determines if a spark ignites chemical memory that will evolve into a light-based memory. Vibration determines the time the energy stays present in the person as euphoria, a dopamine release, or something else that keeps the experience going. The vibration creates a resonance inside our central nervous system. Programs are stuck inside traumas, like an echo in our consciousness, bouncing through the canyons of time.

Harmony, frequency, and vibration create an equation the conscious mind entangles by choice. That is separate from the journey of charge and polarity. The signature frequency of the now has non-cognition then cognition as its process. There's an agenda in us that is always trying to force matches out of choice. The choice is trying to force the universe to conform. Certain choices are backed with daily practice, blissfulness, joy, and all the other things not forcing but allowing the spirit of God, or whatever we want to call it, to work with and through us in non-competition. At that level of co-creation synchronicities are aligned to create bliss if we don't force them out of a need to control.

Frequency can be conceptualized as the intensity of light emission. Frequency determines the ability we have to affect everything in one degree of separation from us on all dimensions, time streams, and existences, the spark, the intensity, the potency creating light memories that solidify, a blink in the middle of a speech that affects everyone, four words in a speech -- I have a dream -- the frequency of Martin Luther King present in his body, fully in his central nervous system, broadcasting his light out of choice. There comes a point where breaking it down is just meaningless. It's beautiful, and beauty is a whole thing, not a deconstructed thing.

# Natural Living

If we reduced global corruption by thirty-five percent, we'd be at a societal consciousness to pass laws in line with natural co-creative evolution. We could share this space with all sentient species. We could replace the fight for survival with natural thriving. Contemplate the benefits of an evolutionary relationship between humans and an automated workforce. The ill-advised and oft propagated doctrine of robots stealing our jobs keeps humanity holding onto self-inflicted limitations.

The reversal of the false idea of advanced technology bastardizing our standards of living would allow us to recognize the benefits to human evolution. We're natural living beings in an ever-expanding age of quantum computing and advancing technology as part of our birthright and legacy. Automation and robots can replace a variety of dangerous jobs. There will always be things for humans to do. Alternative energy alone would transform the way we live. Liberated energy will produce a liberated living. People will no longer be forced into suburbs and cities, which are the antithesis of living.

Integrating robotic assistance into our daily living is part of the natural evolution for advancing humanity. Combining natural living with technology and making it work is a way of living and operating in the concrete jungle. Any jobs lost by the automation would go into techno-humanoid concepts -- a unique interaction between man and machine. There is no such thing as artificial intelligence taking over humanity on this planet. It still requires us to create, install, operate, and manage it. The reduction of corruption starting at the level of global production lines can bring back real hope for a complete system change.

The next level is adapting the education system to reflect the quantum era starting at nursery and primary school level. The school's curriculum has to include special awareness, artwork, working with animals and other sentient creatures to promote a deep connection to the natural learning and growth stage. The parental responsibilities will have to change as well for both males and females. Less corruption means more time for either or both parents to stay at home with the child and still have a place to go back to or interact with during the rearing of the child.

At thirty-five percent less corruption we should have free globally available medicine and the end of pharmaceutical corporatism running our health and well-being sector. The nature of office buildings and space would change into an environment accessible to global community services and products on diverse scales. At the end of the day getting out of corruption is all about education. To reach illumination we need to understand that evolution does not happen by chance, but by the conscious choices we make. Evolution in the sentient being is a free will choice, not a random act foisted upon us by nature.

Look at how we govern the world. We haven't had a democracy for two hundred years. The current state of affairs opens a window of opportunity to move from opportunistic governance to a true synergistic democracy. The banking system was weaponized in the nineteen-seventies. Banks started dealing with their products. Laws were passed to indemnify them for the criminal acts that followed. The banks are corporations that own other corporations that in turn own humanity.

Hypernormalization -- not so normal if you think about it -- where governments, financiers, and technical Utopians have created a fake world run by corporations and corrupt politicians. We need to step out of the illusion of being trapped in those flawed Utopian ideals and realize we have the power to make a difference. This world needs a court system that knows how to deal with crimes of passion, a government that is transparent, ethically aligned to the greater good of humanity, and proactive in dealing with issues at hand. Governing staff and experienced personnel with an adequate level of education to understand how to conserve our land and how to support its people. We can no longer watch our forests burning to the ground because of bad conservation laws. We've had fifteen years and more of defunding the management of wildfires. There was a time where settlers and Indians worked together in the burning season because they knew they'd lose everything if they did not.

Getting rid of thirty-five percent of corruption would give us a chance to revamp the usage of global media. Positive broadcasting of what is working in this world to inspire and stimulate the global commerce market and bring people together on a universal information platform, instead of spreading fear and drama, manipulating the data flow, and misrepresenting the world view at large. We have to start beating the drums in rhythm with the earth again. There is something that is to be discovered, new consciousness movements coming together and working as one.

Human beings alive today have explored perhaps fifteen percent of their taste spectrum. We can taste light, but we don't know how. We have forgotten. We don't need it to survive anymore. There aren't many naturally occurring toxins in the megacity, aside from the cities themselves. Our taste was a defense mechanism. The subtleties of our palettes are astounding. Two hundred years ago naturally living people could taste rain to come in the air. We can still do it. We've just forgotten.

Humans are limited in our sense of smell. A dog can smell kilometers away. A black bear can smell much better than a hound dog. We have a psychic scent. The nerves for smell go through the third eye -- the rods and cones. Our third eye is a concatenation of all our senses. The sense of smell is linked to deep memory. We can recognize smells from previous lives.

The sense of sight is a concatenation of ears, nose, tongue, and center of gravity. Gravity allows us a sense of touch through our body when we're in motion. It creates gyroscopic effects throughout our chakra systems. Gifted children can read a book by putting their hands on it. This is the time in which were are. There is a flowering of the genome, the founder genes pushing through the global narrative. Our sight is intrinsically linked to the rest of our senses. It can perceive touch as much as it can perceive scent, taste, and sound. Our eyes hear because hearing is an integral part of speaking. A person who has been deaf their whole life can feel the vibrations of their voice which makes up their language system. Their eyes feel the vibration as much as their nose and their tongue and the rest of their body.

# The Promise of Faith

Totem guides, animal medicine, and spirit guides assist us to communicate with other worlds. We speak from our hearts. Our mind is in perfect sync with our heart during the infinite moment our heart is connected to the spirit world. In the fetus of the womb, the very first thing that comes forward is our heart. In the heart is a piece of brain matter, the very first concept of our brain. As our body expands we make a spinal column and a head. The heart separates into two. The new brain is formed by the time the baby reaches twenty to thirty weeks.

Our dreaming body lives in our organs, between the root sacral chakra and a little bit above. It doesn't exist in our heads. When we enter a dream state, we drop the three top chakras into the solar plexus. The human body turns off and goes into sleep paralysis. Lucid dreaming happens when all the upper chakras are in the sacral chakra, building up a wave pattern before going into the root. This is where we have the sacred, mental moment where we say I want to lucid dream. This is how we battle programming. The beginning of our dream state is when we set the rules of how we want to remember. We have total control over our cellular memory at that point.

When people show up in our dreams two things are happening -- it's a self-revelation dream in which we have recreated a residual image of something or someone meant for specific teaching, or we're sharing actual dream space with the other person. Most people are disconnected and cannot remember their dreams. The energy of the dream space is residual and there, and we can correlate it around our heart and sacrum and create mystical experiences in the future. We are traveler energy. We can't remember all our dreams. They're so vast.

Our dream body has taken up much more space and sovereignty than it should have. We don't the proper energy to leave properly. Our dreaming bodies have their missions, separate from us, but their missions ultimately affect the frequencies of the people we love, hate, need, and everything in between. We are our teachers. Our dream bodies go out into time, like an advanced recon force, and layer over the _I am_ presence existence not yet there.

We are the _I am_ apex presence, here and now for the experience, including the sleep experience. We need to preserve enough energy to detect entities, have synchronicities, and mystical experiences.

Faith is a choice. It's a part of consciousness, part of the responsibility assigned to us as the architects of our reality. Most people don't assume that responsibility, but it's given to us nonetheless. Faith restricts our choices, indeed, sometimes it denies a choice. There are moments where faith propels us into an experience and the other side of the experience instantaneously, yielding a powerful experience in light memory which we call metaphysical. The NDE can create faith. A person who was an atheist can come out of an NDE with faith in God and the other side. This clears out all the negative programming around non-judgmental belief programming. It's faith without an agenda. Spirit and faith work through us, not against us. Our judgment and condemnation make us think the universe is working against us. Faith is a choice until surrender to spirit is no longer a choice, instead, an extended flow of experience. We can choose to stop the experience at any time but we don't.

Chemical memories are perpetual. They're produced by feelings when we're stuck in programs at a very low empowered state. As we gain the power of the vagus nerve, any memory that has been layered over and camouflaged with low-frequency vibration can be recalled. We can remember our childhood memories, no matter how traumatic or joyful. Light memories are the mystical experience that defines the universe. There's a point where the experience is so high in frequency finite chemicals can not be sustained. The experience is turned into an infinitely stored light memory that lights up our consciousness. It's very easy for our consciousness to tune in to this bright light.

When the body is flooded with chemical memory it continues to produce memories of this finite chemical level. At times we may have a very powerful chemical memory -- sex, business, travel adventure -- but it's not an ecstatic euphoria that lasts for months. We've had experiences that motivated us. We can tell the difference between a finite and an infinite experience. An overload of chemical memories can kick us out of our bodies. We're no longer present. This can lead to depression, regression, or obsession. Chemical memories use the body as a permanent storage unit. They create many degenerative diseases. We are beings of homeostatic synthesis. It's a state of personal freedom, awareness, and the patterns we create to promote our evolution. It's our legacy and birthright to be in synthesis with all there is, was, and ever will be.

Presence is a choice. The _I am_ is inside the body. It chooses to be in the moment of now without a strategy or an agenda. This is how now can be _I am_ realized, by processing a state of presence as a moment to moment living. This is the _I am_ being fully in the vagus nerve.

Our DNA skinsuits have the potential to work within eight colors and nine bodies. This is superluminal thinking, our DNA birthright as a lineage being. We are currently a seven-color time experiencing the world. The vast majority of worlds out there are two or three colors. A smaller percentage are four, five. and six color worlds. Arcturians and Pleiadians have multiple frequencies of individual time on the surface of their planets, but their worlds don't use Roman numeral time. They use dozens of colors and create more if the factions on the planet agree. We have a variety of beings who come to our seven-color world. Their DNA can only experience three colors, but their world allows them to have layers of reality. We live in a multi-layered Uniworld. There are two color beings right next to us all the time, layered on top of us, aware of us and unaware of us -- rocks, walls, and blades of grass. They are two color life force energies experiencing time. A three-color being experiencing time might be something like a cricket, or a clan of crickets, which is one soul, or a hive of bees, which be two souls in six or seven thousand bees.

If in the fetus in the womb blueprint process a previous _I am_ that was a two-color experiencing being determines it wants to ascend to a three, four, or five-color being. It goes to the astral city soul family related to it in the North Pole -- representing the past -- the Aurora Borealis, and it spends time there charting a course of soul family types it wants to work with before it transits to the South Pole -- representing the future -- signaling to earth mother the being wishes to enter the earth incarnation grid. It spends a frequency, what is called _blue road time_, in which it comes into the fetus state. It waits for an egg, sperm, or seed which has its technology, and it chooses the right astral process to become an animated being. As a sperm-based being the mother and father create the portal of the lineage and the being that is in the blue road astral time becomes the first spark.

The nine-month gestation process is where the former two-color being learns to experience all seven colors of time through the parents. That is the first imprint upon the fetus in the womb process. This is why it's so vital as practitioners of our healing that we return to the fetus in the womb state and once again get communal access to the growth of the blueprint to allow changes. The fetus forgets everything that happened in the astral worlds, all the programming in the North and South Pole. It forgets it had access to the earth mother's incarnation grid, and that it planned its life with the tens of thousands of beings, and made spiritual contracts to create true and false synchronicities. It no longer is aware of all temporary synchronicities that put it on multiple frequencies or timelines because this is a one hundred percent free-will universe.

Our consent is required for everything. We've been taught through the false god system to disempower our consent. Tacit consent is when we give our consent without realizing we've done so. In a free-will world, it's considered a signed contract by the beneficiary of your tacit consent. No answer is still an answer. No choice is still a choice. Sovereignty is the full right and power to be a governing body of one's self, without any interference from outside sources or bodies seen and unseen, physical and nonphysical. It's our free will expression at all levels of experience. Declarations of sovereignty and non-consent are magic. They undo spells and commitments we made, even if we lack full knowledge or memory. Claiming sovereignty transforms our lives. It allows us to co-create in our full capacity -- as free-willed, multidimensional, universal beings. In sovereignty, we practice free will at all times.

During the awakening, our DNA must crystallize. It's so new strands of awareness have the fluidity to grow, like a plant, and create solid neural pathways into many different dimensions. In a sense, we are the future of ourselves, and there will be another future us who is a lot closer to the _awakening_, and our stream of light lengthens from an alpha to a theta pattern. When our wavelength lengthens, the experience becomes more dense and rich. Full fluidity means no internal limitations of spirit stopping us from creating incredibly potent memories backed by faith and spirit. By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling, people can taste, touch, know, sense, smell, feel, and experience. Many people taste hearing or hear through taste or both. When it becomes a tangible experience, it has many unseen languages behind it, defining it more by making the dream space tangible here and now. It's that journey. Make everything real now. Open up the Akashic Records, here and now, at this moment. Then it can be crystallized into our greater form of growth. It's not just observation. Sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it, and people go through awakening based on time-locked experiences.

Crystals and rocks are communities of beings that are part of the sea of consciousness, too. Crystals are part of the implicate and explicate order, simultaneously entangled and unentangled. We can imprint entangled narrative perceptions and agendas upon crystals with our precognitive workforce. A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifests the matter. They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter. Crystal allows us access to the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness based on our capacity to perceive, receive, process, and manifest it. The crystalline structure is materialized, no longer a fluid ocean of awareness or sea of consciousness. When we enter the sixth and seventh dimensions, crystallization is the lower-end technology for generating matter-based awareness.

# Dreamtime Awakening

The original purpose of earth is extraordinary. This gem of a planet was linked with the dream mind of all solar systems so all karma could be resolved in the dreaming mind of earth. It became a beacon for the lost beings who were on their homeworlds or their astral worlds found a rainbow gateway to earth. They were drawn because they could dream and regain their Akashic identity. We on earth are connected to all dreaming minds of this universe. Our only limitation is our creativity. The more creative we are the more infinite we are.

We're still creating karma, but it's not an infinite amount. No matter what we create, it won't reach the infinite state again. Think of it as additional time in a football game, no one knows when it's going to end and we are on shootouts. The galactic ascension machine has finished and we've created a zero-sum gain for them. Domination and control cannot out-create the seven-plus billion humans. It's done. Choose to step out of the hologram. Focus on your bubble of reality and dreamtime. Whatever creates joy and abundance for you are the new energies of creation in the now. There is a sense of entitlement in the spiritual communities that is misleading. This is an individual awakening. We have to create our bubbles of reality, hold our frequencies, shed our old skins.

There exist dreamtime societies. They connect us to the universal mind to improve our evolution as universal beings. They don't operate by borders. They use portals and synapses to bring information from other dimensions and worlds. They operate by signature frequency to create the connections, separations, societies, and synchronicities that concatenate other synchronicities into a theme. There are languages everywhere, and there are languages in the dreamtime.

Every set of themes correlates to a step in our evolution. Dreamtime societies help capable souls go on potent dreamtime journeys -- tens of thousands of places simultaneously to expand dreamtime capacity. There is a dreamtime for our villages, cities, and countries. Every group we are a part of, from the most personal to the most impersonal, is part of our karmic script in an incarnation. This means there are certain lessons everyone in the group must experience. There is karma to being a surname Singh, karma to the region of Punjab the family is staked, karma to being a Sikh, and so on. The same is true for a Texan Christian. There is a dreamtime for all resonant energy of that variant of Christianity in that part of Texas. If we are born into it we resonate with it and we enter its dreamtime. We also have a dreamtime for the human race. When we travel in our dreams we carry the earth signature in our frequency. Some of us dream in even larger realms. When we're good at dreamtime travel we go into the hollow earth, the dreaming body of earth, where we achieve a dream state in which we invite other societies from other places, spaces, and frequencies in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity.

We can't choose who we travel with when we haven't achieved full sovereignty in our dreamworld, but we aren't limited to what our society tells us. We can claim our sleep time and not be affected by our nation's borders. Revocations only go so far to get us out of mediocrity and then we need to create beyond probably not just in language but the artwork, allow the synchronicities to flow.

Certain dreamtime societies help us evolve by going to our next level -- dreaming in many places at once. The purpose is to prove it as a soul, that we can do it, and the _I am_ is the direct manifestation that the universe has happened. It's to validate the great dreamtime awakening for other dreamtime societies who've lost faith it's coming -- a multitude of residual images and emotions calling for remedy and resolve. Some residual images need a residual time. That's why many of them feel layered over. The time gaps are synchronistic manifestations of multiple time frequencies in a dream. That's the Uniworld of all forms of thoughts, concepts, and perceptions layered atop each other. Different timelines are not dependent on each other. They're each a product of themselves.

We can use dreams to resolve karma. We can install dharma by commencing the frequency where karma can no longer hold us back, where we are propelled into creating dharma. We can make manifest in the dreamworld. We can create a solidified memory, a tangible mind space process where we make tangible dream weave frequencies in the photonic light memories we work with. To do this we have to let go of control and expectations. Dream energies can get stuck in the intestinal tract. If we can't remember our dreams this is often a clue.

The world is in our face so much our dream frequency isn't allowed to percolate more of our awareness. We must have a disciplined approach before we go to sleep and before we wake up -- those ten minutes before we get up are ours. It can be the greatest potency of discipline to reclaim ourselves, saying no to our parasympathetic, instantly ripping us out of theta into the alpha state. We can also choose to go back to sleep, back to the dream. We've been sharing dreams since before there was a society.

We're all part of earth's dream. We don't live in her dreaming body. She's got her own. We live on her physical body, but she's simultaneously dreaming with every living being to create a physical body. When we choose to be part of our dreamworld and engage with different dreamtime communities, organizations, and societies on the surface world, we become part of earth's mid-theta and high-theta dream frequency. When we reach the next level, we work high-quality dream frequencies and go on missions. We work with the astral dream world to create a benefit for the seven past and seven future generations, then, ultimately we're dreaming with the celestial dream time society and we go into the hollow earth, the dreaming body of earth, where she achieves a dream state and invites other societies from other places, spaces, and frequencies in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity -- mother earth dreaming with many other planets simultaneously. Her dreaming body is in the inner earth. We get access to it when we have done our due diligence and self-mastery work. When we enter the lucid dreaming state as awakening beings, we can make powerful manifestations within ourselves and the energies around us. The state of mother earth's dreaming body is perfect. There is no need to project unhealthiness onto the earth.

# The Hub of Interconnectivity

We unpack and decode the one million letter celestial alphabet. We want to be the celestial medium of peace. We dedicate this to all there is, was, and ever will be. We are the excellence of execution with flawed perfection. We are humanity. Hear our roar.

There comes a time for those destined for greatness when we must stand before the mirror of meaning and ask, _Why have we been given this courage?_

We are the mirror and the human. This courage is our birthright and legacy in this world. This is the fifth world of peace.

We must look into our own tired eyes, worn from many long journeys through mediocrity. In that moment of self-discovery, many learn we are _soul_ tired of stagnation, _soul_ tired of repetition with our illumination.

Our culture has become stagnant. Our society has become separated from reality for those living within the denomination of currency, a separation of humanity created by the money-driven caste system, a byproduct of world government's inability to do anything to free people from the stagnation and cruelty afflicting them through the free market society, a system using free will to its advantage, creating disadvantages for those that come to the future generations.

Our parents and their parents and theirs before them had a vastly different life than those of the previous thousand generations. We have lost our way to create a synthesis with ourselves. Can we solve our greatest problem of attention and its deficit, because our world screams with things that take us off course? Synthesis isn't just a word, it's a state of personal freedom and awareness for growth within the patterns we create to promote our evolution with our purpose and place in this world.

When in the course of our human events, there comes a moment, looking into the mirror of meaning, when something looks back at us in the raising of one's awareness, a time when some ask questions of the self in reflection, and others lose track of the moment, lost in their own petty need for mystical justification.

It's those few who choose to dissolve old beliefs and habit patterns, foregoing habitual abuse of the self, who are the ones destined for greatness in a world of mediocrity. These self-chosen few know the full powers of the self, and the laws of nature are nature's gifts to us. It's our legacy and birthright to be in synthesis with all there is, was, and ever will be.

Each one of us has the inner fortitude to face the self-created demons of mediocrity. It will be a choice and our ability to enforce our choices to last through the storm of self-doubt and self-deception. Each day we challenge ourselves to become more than we were the day before. We pass on the legacy of the self to our self, so our greatness is not forgotten in the evolving waves of time.

This moment now, as we read or hear these very words, a vast unseen world tunes into us, asking us to listen to the silence that expands our ability to know it, equal to this world, layered over it through thoughts and perception.

We and only we can discern the silence and know how the unseen world speaks to us. As we write and speak these eternal words decoded from the one million letter celestial alphabet, all of us feel the churning of wisdom we have known since the dawn of our eternal births. The great remembering has begun. We know this because we feel it before it has ever been shown to another living person in this world. We have spread it to the rest of the Uniworld layered over all the forms of thought and perception for the expressed purpose of being the celestial medium of peace. In this, we as a species entangled with tens of thousands of other species, no longer have to battle for meaningless control of infinite space. Fear in the form of self-depravity, self-deception, and egotistical actions, redefines and drives so many in the Uniworld to do things unnatural to their natural way of being.

We must face our fear of the unknown and know it's false evidence appearing real. We make it real, for we are the creators of our reality. Too many of us hold false truths to be self-evident, appearing as real now, deforming our ability to store memories without our perception-deception filters guiding us, with fear-based actionable wisdom, driving us further into the charge and polarity of living in the layered Uniworld.

As the creators of our reality, our self-truths are incumbent on our ability to be vigilant and disciplined, holding them as self-evident now, without perception-deception filters, guiding us back into fear, doubt, or the many vices of depravity.

Many of us believe the greatest human power of potential is within our ability to independently think, to choose our own goals, and live our dreams. Within the heart of humankind lives the instinct to know freedom. Here exists the independent psychological predisposition to chart our course.

This is a biological imperative directing us to grow. Choosing the spiritual joy through this biological imperative is the essence of our essence, being one with it as part of us, as a programmable DNA instrument of awareness, as part of our choice-based system of belief, interwoven with the fabric of time-space reality.

The history of our past actions all too often retells the tales of life traumas, repeated without learning how to heal from them, nagging unhappiness with our path, lack of clear purpose, or anything that does not promote us as conscious beings of choice who must go through the thick and thin of life's offerings from a world mired in mediocrity.

Too many of our world cultures teach a blind desire to be judged worthy, lovable, accepted as part of the pack of conformists. We must learn about our hero's journey, the steps forward to do its great work, regardless of the projections put upon by those around them, including loved ones who are still in the hypnosis of obedience and slavery. A hero's stance is frightening to those who unquestionably conform.

We, as heroes, will not become subject to the tyranny of fools and the fool's desire to entangle with us in the fool's mission of self-deception. Too many of our species are lost to the abyss of unawareness, blissfully ignorant to all of nature's gifts within the joyous moment of the now. We can no longer live in the apathy of the moment of now. We must be present to reclaim our authority and its wonderful gifts that exist in the now, given away to the system of cultural mediocrity and deprivation of our relation with nature.

If we should choose to be a conscious being of choice in full awareness, our choice is ours to use, discard, or give away to others. We and only we can attain personal freedom from the conformists who demand we conform. This is a form of cultural hypnosis that uses pre and post-cultural hypnotic suggestions demanding we respond to the needs of others, pulling us at every choice point, changing the course of our daily evolution into meaningless pursuits of false emergencies. This creates an inner detachment from our clear intentions and actions. Personal evolution becomes a TV series we binge-watch, thus lessening our ability to even know synthesis. It's our birthright and legacy, we must explore with a clear heart, clear mind, and knowing,

The world will demand we conform. We step into our greatness with these truths self-evident to our beingness, in stages of action reclaiming our power and authority to be ourselves without conforming to the whims and fancies of others needing to make us conform to their reality rules.

All too often mankind forgets the unnatural foe of our life path is the distant vision of death driving us into choice points we adhere to with vigilant force. We stop our evolution. The truth is we only have these moments of now. The byproduct of this form of thinking is present in the moment-to-moment detachment from natural living.

This is unnatural to the way of nature, a creation by man's need to make others conform to thought constructs and ideologies of the past generations, demanding we make them relevant to grow. All too often mankind does not have vibrant awareness of its own emotions. Lack of emotions means one cannot feel the subtle energy surrounding our body, mind, and spirit as a complex hologram of light encoded in memories from lifetime to lifetime. We must choose to feel again and again.

Each time we choose to feel, allowing the raw emotions to help define our course of action into our great work, so our great work can have a great impact on those we love. The choice to feel is our birthright and legacy. Each day we must challenge the gates of apathy and drive forward our hologram with full presence and the potential power of being in the now.

There are things inside us all that create self-sabotaging habit patterns. These habitual patterns take on the forms of unhealed traumas, rearing their head during our times of internal crisis. Whenever we choose to be authentic with ourselves or loved ones, these patterns become programs of potent power from denial of our self-growth, our internal demons. Our internal demons poison the well of inspiration, turn hope toxic and dispel goodwill into hatred, rage, and anger. Our destiny is determined in large part on how well we know our internal demons of self-doubt and self-deprivation, and how they use shame, blame, and guilt to distort our perceptions of people, places, and things, diminishing a potent power that can assist us in manifesting our dreams, desires, and needs, so we lead fulfilled lives. How we battle them and choose to win each day will be determined by the mettle we create within ourselves. The path to self-mastery begins with identifying our internal demons and flipping the frequencies on their arguments for our limitations. Find our arguments for success and challenge our internal demons to go back to the recesses of our minds and sit in the corner, powerless to overcome our will to be a concise being of choice in these moments of now. If we don't defeat our demons, who will? The external will not save us. It will only make us conform to the global narrative.

Many wonder why we cannot mature as fast as we could, seeing others leapfrog ahead of the pack of conformists when we cannot advance. We are stuck in pause, waiting and waiting for permission to declare our dreams and true intentions, struggling for what we want out of our life walk. We await the time for personal courage to arise within us, like sexual stimulation, or for society to permit us to activate our inner genius and in turn activate the inner genius of others.

This is the illusion and delusion all wrapped into a perfect enigma, surrounded by a conundrum of lack of self-worth. We have forgotten courage is a choice, and permission and impetus to move with bold decisive action aren't given by the global narrative or the impotent masses entrenched in mediocrity.

To seek change is to go against the grain of those demanding conformity to ideological and cultural patterns of limitation, truly advancing to the unknown with the choice to make it known, letting go of fear, envy, and resentment, flying aloft on the wings of understanding, enjoying the reckless abandon of shedding off the conformists will suppress our desires to know the unknown. It's our birthright and legacy as a conscious being of choice on the path to self-mastery.

The bold and disciplined invite need to grow. It's our savior from the fearful masses who will never hold their power until they too are faced with their internal demons and shed off the needs of the conformed masses who have forgotten that courage is a choice. What awaits them is the presence of choice itself and the potential power of living in the natural moment of now.

At the edge of infinity with our expression of being in the now, we unpack and decode the unlimited point of view within our state of emanation. It's the valuables and variables we choose to emanate that define us throughout history as the living, breathing manifestation of peace to all there is, was, and ever will be.

It's now that the moment of now understanding is uncoded, with our internal pattern recognition of the now, through the perspective of our eternal selves, within our moments of now which recognize and actualize all parts of ourselves, so a precognitive workforce may flow through all there is, was, and ever will be. It's the actualization and valuation that drives forward our hologram of light.

# Human, Hero, Champion

Masterful out creation of the repetition that yields no illumination in karmic resolution. What follows is my will to express my internal masterful self in masterful out creation of the systems of distraction.

I in the ever present moment of now choose to form a multi-layered spiritual court of equity, for the expressed purpose for sharing the Akashic Records at the proper scale and size so the beings of light manifest now may reclaim their birthright legacy of knowing and not unknowing blissful ignorance of the multilayered truth world we live in the now.

This is the map in non-competition with all other frequencies of light. We create this in the pyramid of the self, that temple of the self where we have danced in the shadows and the patterns of all former selves and accepted who we are in the now, that mighty pyramid of the self is where the bubble of protected no time creates the _I am_ heart now statement.

I summon all ancestors past, present, and future in equal co-creation non-competition non-hierarchical order to populate this manifest now spiritual court of equity so the manifest now may begin the process of expansion of knowing for the expressed purpose of revealing our race amnesia, so we as a species in global unity may begin to tell the tales of the ancestors past, present, and future.

I call to earth mother who holds sacred space for all life within in her realms of light existence. Come occupy this multidimensional spiritual court of equity. I ask you to be the sovereign neutral auditor of time space existence within this expression of teaching the Akashic Record to this first pod of whale people assembled in the mighty co-creative moment of now.

Here in the now we anchor the Akashic Record frequency. We do this by sharing light codes in the form of language in a third density manifest world. With these words we make sacred our expression by holding the sacred neutral position

You, in the mighty moment of now, have so many choices. The first group of choices that you want to look at is _What are you manifesting in your sovereign boundaries?_ Here's where you can perform spiritual surgery on yourself, where you can learn about the old habit patterns that make you lazy, or unencumbered, or over-encumbered with emotions. This is where, in that powerful meditative moment, you can pull the power of choice and say _I am now removing that from my signature frequency of being._

I am no longer a match for that subject matter that constantly creates a cyclical habit pattern of self-destruction, self-disease creation, or any other form of co-creation with zealot energy that leads me away from my divine, co-creative, inner transforming self, taking it step by step so the process of life doesn't become a series of instant gratified moments, but the infinite of our soul, learning from the great experience of the _I am_ and the now.

Allowing equal co-creation to be a part of our regular, everyday life, will be the true challenge of those who want to live the mystical life daily, because there are times we choose to do our mediation, and our desire is to have that micro-mystical moment. And that is the subtle levels of instant gratification and our reality layers coming to us with the co-creative, divine force of the infinite spirit, reminding us, even in those instant moments, we aren't gratified. We are showing layers of wisdom in our knowing and we simply must be present enough to unpack and uncode the mystical experience so we understand that it isn't gratifying a part of us -- it is fulfilling us.

Tonight is the night I accept my role in human DNA development. This is a choice in the mighty co-creative moment of now. This choice fully accepts my friendship to all friends. This _I am_ self fully understands it's purpose. This being of the now is the signature frequency of the time. This _I am_ dreaming now is in communal oneness with the four doorways of self perception.

I manifest my _I am_ presence self in the dream lodge of peacemakers co-creation. I end my eternal struggle of density manifest accepting my role as the peacemaker and peacekeeper as a multi-density manifest _I am_ presence dreaming self in equal co-creation non-competition with its ancient present now using the DNA super technology of communion and union as the density action of remedy and resolve in the seen and unseen layers of light perception.

Trust is a set of choice points that dovetail into knowing. When the choice points are complete, trust is a three edged sword -- seen, unseen, unknowing.

Trust has many seen and unseen scales in the subtle energy background. Until we can learn to see the subtle energy field around us trust as a concept will be limited to our five senses combined to make our sixth sense which is to be judgment free. A judgment free point of view is in essence the sacred neutral point of view. We adopt, adapt or assimilate the sacred neutral point of view each day we allow the mystical to change our perception without self deception based off our subtle trusting emotions of the moment.

So many of trust and missed-trust moments exist without fully understanding the moment and all of its infinite possibilities that come in a moment of choice based trust.

How do we stop the projections of others mistrust upon us. Or how do we let go of the over trusting energies that suppress our clear intentions. We give away power on such grand and minuscule levels. And trust is one of those choice exchange points of energy.

Trust is an overbearing subject at times because it beckons us to deal with the most upfront issues we have. It means our sympathetic and parasympathetic are actually trying to gauge our trust and create moments of doubt, self-doubt, internal or external, so the choice point of trust is directly affected by the controlling synaptic central nervous system that believes it is fully the soul and nothing else. Everyone on the healing path has the parts of them that do not want to grow. Our parasympathetic represents that within us and is frequently trying to get our choice points of trust to have self doubt within them.

You are a special unique signature frequency of being, created solely for the moments of now. After the moments of now pass and the world comes into balance, a great reassembling of earth's greatest champions will be reunited in spirit council.

They will be asked to create books of wisdom to be passed down the many future generations of dreamers and peacekeepers.

I call to the medicine of the dreams of the southern skies. I ask them to aid me in co-creating a message to all sentient kind living and co-existing in all of earth's realms.

_Aho red road brothers and sisters_. We call out beyond the dream wave direct into your knowing heart space. We speak these words of dreaming unity. Know all is well. The path is clear. The way is not broken. All frequency of light now flows in and out of the Uniworlds of self-reflection and expressions of the self in _I am_ moments of the now

The next layer of knowing is for those on the red road living blue lives as equal co-creators in the dance of life. Your spirit has done its work on both sides. Now is the time you see the work for what it was with equal eyes of knowing revealed.

I call to earth mother who holds sacred space for all life within in her realms of light existence. Come occupy this multi dimensional spiritual court of equity. I ask you to be the sovereign neutral auditor of time-space existence within this expression of teaching the Akashic Record to this first pod of whale people assembled in the mighty co-creative moment of now.

I call to the galactic central sun who is the source of our prime creation of spiritual commerce in the frame of galactic existence. I ask that you be the sovereign neutral auditor of time space so I may understand the scale and size in which this soul stream works on through this manifest moment of the now.

I call to the universal central sun of this universe that holds sacred space for all life incarnating within the entirety of all this is, this universe seen and unseen. I ask you to come into this multidimensional spiritual court of equity for the expressed purpose of aiding all sovereign neutral whiteness encapsulated within this spiritual court of equity to understand the difference in scale and size in which all source streams work with.

I in the ever present moment of now open a unique sacred moment of moments. With the power of choice I open a zero point floating anchor point in hierarchical time-space. I empower this no-time sacred creation with all ancestors past, present, and future; to be a lucid dream space construct available to all those who can emanate heart-spaced awareness without strings or conditions attached as their methods and ways of daily life. Choosing balance of extremes, choosing exploration of the heart-mind construct without saving charge or polarity to argue for limitations or fears.

I unify my dream _I am_ self with the global dreamtime of earth mind. I empower this space of all time with all master codices of time space creations. I summon the dancing shamans of earth's dreaming mind to aid us in dancing the dream of life. I ask the dancing shamans to use the power of rhythm inside time to syncopate a seen and unseen world on communion and union in equal co-creation.

Aho earth mother, who holds this sacred space so I may create sacred space within. I call to you at this moment of moments, in which I look to the wholeness of myself in all forms of reality. I call upon earth to assist me in unraveling the story that is me unfolding in my perception of the now. Help me use hindsight and foresight in a method and manner that continues the co-creation with our realms. It is here I choose to make spiritual contracts with streams of dream light in the ancient past. Now the ancient future is present in these moments of moments.

The healer's tools have been laid out in a ceremonial fashion. The grouse feather to the east, revealing the dawn of a new age of man. To the north the bear claw necklace honors the dreams of the ancestors on the blue road of spirit. The south direction holds the cocoon of friend butterfly, waiting for us to become innocent with joy once more. Transforming our state of life into the next layer of the dream weave. To the west, the black stone doorway remains clear with intentions past, present, and future. The way is clear, the path is not broken with the footsteps of the ancestors charting a course for all future dreamers to enter the silence and know the dreamtime is not separate but equally layered over each other, creating the Uniworld we live in.

So now is the time to act in the heart mind protected _I am_ presence frame work and begin the great work of self-education of sacred living, self-education of spiritual hygiene and the self-education of sacred discipline actualized each day with a joyous heart, learning from it and chronicling it for the later viewer to see the growth within the micro moments of footsteps of life.

The choice is easy. The endurance of change that will determine your commitment to the sacred discipline of accepting and giving in equal co-creation, non-competition, non-hierarchical order.

You build your endurance and strength each breath you take, each sovereign sleep you have, each moment being a match for communion and union consciousness from within. Emanate this learn and relearn not to emulate. Once you understand emanation of the message your power, position and understanding of duality will reveal the next layer of sovereign choice to expand your self in equal co-creation with organic natural co-creative evolution with your heart and great mystery's universal heart.

The winds of perception change course as human and spirit-nation-kind come one step closer to understanding the ever present co-creative moment to moment living. This natural way of life exists for all sentient kind living and co-existing on all of earth mother's realms. The heart of the horse is the fabric of the dreamscape we all live in.

It is the horse who spread the fabric of reality spider wove, so we could dream the ever present co-creative dream linked to all other realities on all dimensions, time streams, galaxies and universes. This was earth's children's mission. To be the unvanquished dream of free co-creation. Now in this moment I continue forth on the blazing trail. I now see those on this path have assembled like perfect sections of the great mystery.

I am the living shaman knowing I must go through regular life reviews so I may let go that which does not want to go forth on the sacred path of living.

I demand the instant separation of natural incarnation and forced reincarnation interwoven lifetimes, so I may see from both perspectives who I was, what I was and what I was born into willingly, unwillingly, known or unknown. In my search for the truth I see all sides of the quantum entanglement equation.

This _I am_ presence declares sovereign boundaries so we may hold sacred space within each of our selves without worry of invasion from any source not in alignment with Global dreamtime and unity consciousness for all sentient kind existing and co-existing on all of earth mother's realms.

I now state with all ancestors present, _I am_ ready to invoke my natural rights as a universal citizen born to earth mother's specific signature frequency.

The more we allow ourselves to experience and grow with the infinite point of view, the more ancient future now energy becomes manifest in our seen and unseen world. Take the prayer pipe of inner peace being offered from your blue road ancestors. Breathe deeply, with the knowledge and wisdom, we are creating it all.

The ancestors dreaming us before our birth and us dreaming them before their birth. We are the cyclical dreamers of the western doorway of perception. Each direction, each breath from the sacred pipe brings in new points of view, so we can calibrate our soul frequency, to the ever evolving ideas of manifested peace.
